## Process

We engage, or are involved in processes all the time; in both our personal and professional lives.

### Processes and IT Security

Cyberattacks and Alerts are increasing and growing exponentially complex and targeted.

This requires more time and attention from Security Analysts. IT Security teams are increasingly needing to take charge of their threat management operations with a proactive approach.

### Enabling Success

Security Operations Centers (SOC) need to have the current key skills, tools, and processes to be able to detect, investigate and stop threats before they become costly data breaches.

- As volumes of security alerts and false positives grow, more burden is placed upon Security Analyst & Incident Response Teams.

## Business Process Management Overview

Process
: A set of defined, repeatable steps that take inputs, add value, and produce outputs that satisfy a customer's requirements.

![Business Process](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3c1915d227e89fd8c51f76b03e35f615?rik=VFqSeT1R7agvsg&riu=http%3a%2f%2f1.bp.blogspot.com%2f-oCGLWHjH4e0%2fThHUctRzMjI%2fAAAAAAAAAvk%2f4U_XNzE3f74%2fs1600%2f5.bmp&ehk=m0D00RFj4drgR1hxyrkCx%2f2Veh7Zr79IGZaEJvzDzxY%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)

Inputs
: Information or materials that are required by the process to get started.

Outputs
: Services, or products that satisfy customer requirements.

Bounds/Scope
: The process starts when...and ends when...

Tasks/Steps
: Actions that are repeatable.

### Process Roles

Process Team

- Supplier
- Requestor
  - Team Lead
    - SME
      - Processor
        - Approver
        - Reviewer
- Customer

It is critical to have a separation of duties such that an approver is not the requestor.

*What makes a process successful?*

1. Charter
2. Clear Objectives
3. Governance/Ownership
4. Repeatability (reduced variation)
5. Automation
6. Established performance indicators (metrics)

### Process Performance Example

Example where process metrics could identify a serious flaw in the process.

RR&R Manufacturing makes the rivets that go into the assembling of the skins on commercial jet wings.

- The RR&R Quality Assurance team reviews process metrics on a monthly basis.

### Process Performance Metrics

It is critical that we measure our processes, so understand if they are performing to specifications and producing the desired outcome every time; and within financial expectations.

- Cycle Time
- Quality (Defect Rate)
- Rework
- Cost

### Continual Process Improvement

Regular review of:

Process Metrics &rarr; Customer Feedback &rarr; Maturity Assessments &rarr; Financial Performance

- Continual and process improvement refer to as CPI. It is the ongoing cycle of always reviewing process performance metrics and customer feedback.
- Small improvement teams are critical because key individuals and SMEs get together from a department with the process owner.

## Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Overview

### Defined ITIL: IT Infrastructure Library

- ITIL is a best practice framework that has been drawn from both the public and private sectors internationally.
- It describes how IT resources should be organized to deliver Business Value.
- It models how to document processes, functions and roles of IT Service Management (ITSM).

### Components of the ITIL Service Lifecycle Phases

![ITIL Phases](https://www.interfacett.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/002-components-phases-of-a-service-lifecycle.png)

#### Service Strategy

Service Portfolio Management
: Process of tracking, indexing & maintaining a list of all the customer-oriented services offered for the customer needs.

Financial Management
: Process to provide accurate and cost-effective governance of IT assets and resources used in providing IT services. Also responsible for planning, controlling and recovering costs of providing IT services.

Demand Management
: Planning technique used to forecast, plan for and manage the demand for products and services for a period of time to match supply with the market demand.

Business Relationship Management
: Maintain a positive relationship with customers.

#### Service Design

Service Catalogue Management
: Provides vital information like service details, present status, and the service interdependencies, ofr all other Service Management processes.

Service Level Management
: Helps achieve the target service level by ensuring proper agreements are in place with internal IT support providers and external suppliers in the form of Operation Level Agreements (OLAs) and Underpinning Contracts (UCs), respectively.

Information Security Management
: Describes the approach and controls the measure of IT security inside an organization.

Supplier Management
: Managing suppliers and the services they supply, to provide seamless quality of IT Services in an economical manner.

#### Service Transition

Change Management
: Guides an organization to optimize the use of resources, business process, budget allocations, or the other modes of operation, by making significant changes to them.

Project Management
: Plan and coordinate the resources to deploy new or changed services within the predicted cost, time and quality estimates.

Release & Deployment Management
: Process of managing, planning, scheduling and controlling the rollout of IT Services, updates & releases to the production environment.

Service Validation & Testing
: Ensure that developed releases and the resulting services meet customer expectations in terms of its quality and the value it provides to them.

Knowledge Management
: Helps organization achieve their goals by making the best use of knowledge.

#### Service Operation

Event Management
: Responsibility to communicate every event details to appropriate functions responsible for the processing of that event.

Incident Management
: Responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents.

Problem Management
: Responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems that happen or could happen in an IT service.

#### Continual Service Improvement (CSI)

Always trying to improve process.

- Review metrics
- Identify opportunities
- Test & prioritize
- Implement improvements

### Key ITIL Processes

Problem Management
: The process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all problems.

- ITIL defines a 'problem' as an unknown cause of one more incidents.

Change Management
: Manages changes to baseline service assets and configuration items across the ITIL lifecycle.

Incident Management
: An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT Service, a reduction in the quality of an IT Service, and/or failure of configuration item.

- Log &rarr; Assign &rarr; Track &rarr; Categorize &rarr; Prioritize &rarr; Resolve &rarr; Close

Event Management
: Events are any detectable or discernible occurrence that has significance for the management of IT Infrastructure, or the delivery or an IT service.

Service Level Management
: Involves the planning, coordinating, monitoring, and reporting on Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It is the ongoing review of service achievements to ensure that the required service quality is maintained and gradually improved.

Information Security Management
: Deals with having and maintaining and Information Security Policy (ISP) and specific security policies that address each aspect of strategy, objectives, and regulations.
