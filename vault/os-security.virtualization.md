## Virtualization

Allows to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system.

- Hypervisor / Host
- Virtual machine / Guest

### Hypervisor

- Separate the physical resources from the virtual environments.
- Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (end user) or be installed directly onto hardware (enterprise).

### Virtual Machine

- The virtual machine functions as a single data file.
- The Hypervisor relays requests from the VM to the actual hardware, is necessary.
- VMs does not interact directly with the host machine.
- Physical hardware is assigned to VMs.

## Virtualization to Cloud Computing

Virtualization allows to run software resources with less physical resources.

### Cloud Deployment

1. Consolidate &rarr; Visualize
2. Automate &rarr; Manage
3. Cloud &rarr; Integrate &rarr; Optimize

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is an on-demand availability of system resources - An environment that has virtualized devices that will serve a business purpose.

### Comparison of Types

Cloud computing comes in three forms:

![Cloud](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_PfopP8ZDMwtzebg.png)

- Public - The most common form of cloud deployment, makes resources available to the public via the Internet by a free or subscription based.
  - Functionality between public cloud differs from provider to provider.
  - Offer higher elasticity and scalability at a lower cost.

- Private - Dedicated for single-use, where resources of the private cloud are located on-premises or are operated by a third-party vendor at an offsite location.

- Hybrid - A mix of public and private cloud solutions, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
