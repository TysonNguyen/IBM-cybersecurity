## Types of Actors and their Motives

- **Hackers (Pay or not)** = They can be attacks that are paid by private or public organizations. Or simply someone with enough knowledge and time to bother.

- **Internal Users** = They are still the most likely to cause security problems, whether intentional or not. Loss and sale of information is the most normal, along with the installation of malware.

- **"Hacktivisim"** = Similar to governments but usually do not have much financial power. Normally they reveal sensitive or confidential information to the public and carry out DDoS campaigns.

- **Governments** = They have enough power to cause very large financial and operational losses, it is normal to attack infrastructure, spy and monitor important politicians and are the most used APT.

### Motivation Factors

- **Just Play**: Demonstrate the capabilities of the group or the individual, on the hackers community.

- **Gain money**: In conjunction with governments or criminal organizations.

- **Political action and movements**: Make an statement or fight for a specific reason.

- **Hire Me!**: Demonstrate what can I do for somebody to hire me or use my services.

### Hacking organizations

- **Fancy Bear** organization collated with 2016 U.S election hack.
- **Anonymous**
- **Syrian Electronic Army**

Next, the espionage from countries from different actors will increase with advanced malware and a lot of them.

There will be new technologies and human knowledge gap about cybersecurity and protecting their information.
