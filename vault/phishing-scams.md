Phishing
: Known as 'brand spoofing' or 'carding', is a term used to describe various scams that use (primarily) fraudulent e-mail messages, sent by criminals, to trick you into divulging personal information. The criminals use this information to steal your identity, rob your bank account, or take over computer.

- Phishing comes from the analogy that Internet scammers are using e-mail lures to 'fish' for passwords and financial data from the sea of Internet users.
  - Was first used by hackers to describe stealing America Online (AOL) accounts by acquiring usernames and passwords.
- Some scams are using instant messaging (IM), fake news bulletins, and social communities to fool users into divulging personal information.

A variety of tactics are used to make the recipient of the email believe that they have received the phishing email from a legitimate user or a legitimate domain, including...

- Using a message From: address that looks very close to one of the legitimate addresses.
- An alarm, a financial lure, or otherwise attractive situation, that either makes the recipient panic or tempts the recipient into taking an action.

Spoofed domains can be difficult for users to visually discern, and often mirror legitimate domains used by the impersonated company. An authentic-looking website can help convince a user to divulge personal data on a malicious website if it resembles the original closely enough.
