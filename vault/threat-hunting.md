## Global Cyber Trends and Challenges

The world now depends on cyberspace more than ever to manage their banking transactions, investments, work and personal communications, shopping, travel, utilities, news, and even social networking.

- A massive interference with global trade, travel, communications, and access to databases caused by a worldwide Internet crash would create an unprecedented challenge.

### Challenges

- Almost half of breaches are caused by malicious or criminal acts.
- Average 191 days to detect and 66 days to resolve a situation.
- Agencies are faced with more frequent and sophisticated attacks.
- Cyber skills shortage.
- Too many tools from too many vendors.

#### The Rise of Advanced Threats

- Highly resourced bad guys.
- Highly sophisticated.
- Can evade detection from rule and policy based defenses.
- Dwell in the network.
- Can cause the most damage.

#### Grenade of Threat Surface

- Targeted 'acts of war' & terrorism.
- Indirect criminal activities designed for mass disruption.
- Targeted data theft.
- Espionage
- 'Hacktivists'.

Countermeasure challenges include:

- Outdated security platforms.
- Increasing levels of cyber crime.
- Limited marketplace skills.
- Increased citizen expectation.
- Continuous and ever increasing attack sophistication.
- Lack of real-time correlated cyber intelligence.

#### #1 Challenge of SOC Leaders

The detection of advanced threats (hidden, unknown, and emerging).
****
- 91% of security leaders reports threat hunting increased the speed and accuracy of response.
- 20% of threats are unknown, undetected and can cause the most damage.
  - Threat hunting helps find the unknown and undetected threats before it is too late.

## SOC Cyber Threat Hunting

Cyber Threat Hunting
: The act of proactively and aggressively identifying, intercepting, tracking, investigating and eliminating cyber adversaries as early as possible in the Cyber Kill Chain.

- The earlier you locate and track adversaries Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), the less impact these adversaries will have on your business.
  - Cyber forensic investigation is done by level 3/4 analysts within the SOC.

### Humans

Humans are the primary driver of cyber threats affecting organizations.

- Problem: Humans are transnational criminals creating cyber threats.
- Solution: Proactive cyber threat investigation / hunting.

### Know Your Enemy: Cyber Kill Chain

## Industry Example

### Six Key Use Cases and Examples of Enterprise Intelligence

- Cyber Threat Hunting = Net new discovery of correlating low levels alerts and offenses.
  - SOC Director
  - Head of Threat Intel
  - CISO
  - CTO
- Watch-lists and Vetting = Greatly increased efficiency of investigation
  - Lead investigator
- Insider Threat = Identified discoveries of employees abusing privileges.
  - Head of SIU
- VIP Protection = Immediate alerting of threats to VIPs and direct link to law enforcement.
  - Head of Threat Intel
  - Cyber Intel Director
- Fraud Investigation = Identified net new money chain transfers.
  - Head of FIU
- Threat Discovery = Immediate alerting on brand compromises and fraud on dark web.
  - Head of FIU
  - Head of Brand Protection
