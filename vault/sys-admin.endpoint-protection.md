## Basics of Endpoint Protection

Endpoint protection management is a policy-based approach to network security that requires endpoint devices to comply with specific criteria before they are granted access to network resources.

- Endpoint security management systems, which can be purchased as software or as a dedicated appliance, discover, manage and control computing devices that request access to the corporate network.
- Endpoint security systems work on a client/server model in which a centrally managed server or gateway hosts the security program and an accompanying client program is installed on each network.

### Unified Endpoint Management

A Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) platform is one that converges client-based management techniques with Mobile device management (MDM) application programming interfaces (APIs).

- Process to manage, secure and control enterprise-owned and employee-owned mobile devices, desktops, laptops and other endpoints from a single unified platform.
- The first step to enable today's enterprise ecosystem.
  - Devices and things
  - Apps and content
  - People and identity

#### Traditional Client Management Systems

- Involves an agent-based approach.
- Great for maintenance and support.
- Standardized rinse & repeat process.
- Applicable for some OS & servers.

#### Mobile Device Management

- API-based management techniques.
- Security and management of corporate mobile assets.
- Specialized for over-the-air configuration.
- Purpose-built for smartphones & tablets.

#### Modern Unified Endpoint Management

## Endpoint Detection and Response

Key mitigation capabilities for endpoints.

- Deployment of devices with network configurations.
- Automatic quarantine/blocking of non-compliant endpoints.
- Ability to patch thousands of endpoints at once.

Endpoint detection and response:

- Automatic policy creation for endpoints.
- Zero-day OS updates.
- Continuous monitoring, patching and enforcement of security policies across endpoints.

### Examine Endpoint Security Solution

Kye factors to consider:

- Threat Hunting
- Detection Response
- User Education
