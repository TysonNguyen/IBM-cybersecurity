[Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computer systems, restricting users’ access to the infected systems. Ransomware variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert. Typically, these alerts state that the user’s systems have been locked or that the user’s files have been encrypted. Users are told that unless a ransom is paid, access will not be restored. The ransom demanded from individuals varies greatly but is frequently $200–$400 dollars and must be paid in virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)

## Types of Ransomware

### Crypto

- Encrypt the sensitive files located on the victim's computer, such as documents, pictures, or videos to prevent access until ransom is paid.

### Locker

- Solely aims to lock victims out of their entire computer devices until ransom is paid.

### Leakware/Doxware

- Threaten to release footage from webcam, or any incriminating files that may be on a computer.
  - May release to the public or specific people until ransom is paid.

## Attack Vectors

There are many different ways a user can fall victim to a ransomware, though most can be avoided with proper security education and protocols.

- Phishing
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Software vulnerabilities
- Malicious Links

## Prevention

The best way to prevent being a victim of ransomware is to keep a backup of all your data, keep your software up to date and use complex passwords for your network and computer.

- Use an anti-virus or related security software, and stay vigilant in verifying any link or attachment you click on.

### Backup

Having a full backup removes the threat of losing data.

### Update Software & Passwords

Updated software and strong passwords is the first line of defense.

### Antivirus

Security software scanning for malicious attachments or changes to computer combats phishing.

### Beware of Links

Beyond emails, websites can be spoofed and visiting or clicking on links can download ransomware.

## Examples

[Infections can be devastating to an individual or organization, and recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the encrypted files will be released; it only guarantees that the malicious actors receive the victim’s money, and in some cases, their banking information. In addition, decrypting files does not mean the malware infection itself has been removed.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)

### Why it is Effective

The authors of ransomware instill fear and panic into their victims, causing them to click on a link or pay a ransom, and users systems can become infected with additional malware.
  
- “Your computer was used to visit websites with illegal content. To unlock your computer, you must pay a $100 fine.”
- “Your computer has been infected with a virus. Click here to resolve the issue.”
- “All files on your computer have been encrypted. You must pay this ransom within 72 hours to regain access to your data.”

### Locky

- Encrypts over 160 file types.
- Uses phishing to target those with designer, engineering, or developer file types.

### WannaCry

- Spread across 150 countries in 2017.
- Capitalized on out of date software in the healthcare industry.
- 4 billion in losses worldwide.

### Bad Rabbit

- Used fake adobe flash website to install malware.

### Ryuk

- Spread in 2018 and disabled the Windows System Restore button.
- Encrypted networked drives as well.

### Troldesh

- Was popular in 2015 and went for quantity over quality.
- Caught victims through spam email links and attachments.

### Jigsaw

- Named after the Saw horror films.
- "Tormented" victims by deleting files incrementally with each hour the ransom was not paid.

### CryptoLocker

- Spread through email attachments.
- Impacted half million computers.
- Was countered by law enforcement.

### Petya

- Precursor to GoldenEye.
- Encrypted entire hard drive.

### GoldenEye

- Resurfaced around the same time WannaCry was popular.
- Targeted high profile users and locked them out completely.

### GandCrab

- Claimed to have used the users webcam to record personal moments and threatened to release the footage unless a ransom was paid.

## Ransomware of Things (RoT)

- An organization become increasingly dependent on tech solutions, the scope for ransomware only increases.
- The increasing use of internet-connected industrial control systems, smart buildings, and vehicles including autonomous vehicles is creating new areas of exploitation.
- Remote locking of vehicles, homes, and buildings could be abused for extortion. 
  - Manipulation of BAS such as those controlling HVAC could serve as a basis for new schemes.

## Case Study - City of Atlanta 

- In the early morning of March 22, 2018, the City of Atlanta suffered a widespread Ransomware attack.
- The breach shuttered many devices at City Hall for about five days in an extensive infection.
- The virus used to attack the city was the SamSam Ransomware.
- To unlock the city's systems, and data, hackers demanded by $51,000 in Bitcoin, in which the city refused to pay.

### Timeline

1. March 22, 2018: Ransomware cyberattack dealt a widespread blow to the city of Atlanta, the state capital and home to the nation's busiest airport.
  - Devices at City Hall shut down for five days.
  - Law enforcement temporarily writing incident reports by hand and video.
  - Stopping online or in-person payments of tickets, water bills, and business licenses, and renewals.
2. Atlanta disabled the Wi-Fi at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport until April 2nd.
3. In May, the city restored its online water bill payment system.
4. In June, the court's online bill payment option and docket boards returned.

### Vulnerabilities

There was no plan in place if an attack occurred.

#### Operations During an Attack

Despite the breach, Atlanta's 911 system and its emergency response was unaffected, and major utilities including water and sewer services continued.

- Retained the manual processes and institutional knowledge needed to revert to traditional methods of service provision and had plans in place to keep doing business during the attack.
- Did not understand the impact of the threat on all operations.

#### Readiness of Systems

- Lack of spending upgrading their infrastructure.
- Large number of vulnerabilities logged in a January 2018 audit.
  - Found 1,500 to 2,000 vulnerabilities in the city systems, and suggested that the number of vulnerabilities had so large that workers grew complacent.

### Cost

- The attack could cost taxpayers $17 million - up from earlier estimates of 2.7 million.
- The latest cost estimate includes about $6 million in existing contracts for security services and software upgrades and 11 million in potential costs associated with the attack, including new desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets.
- This would mark one of the U.S.' costliest cyberattacks affecting a local government in 2018, despite city officials declining to pay the ransom demanding by the hackers.

### Prevention

- IT officials must know their network architecture, invest in email infrastructure, and remain vigilant at all levels, scrutinizing emails and their attachments and looking for browser vulnerabilities.
- Multi-factor authentication is immensely valuable and segmentation is crucial.
- State and local governments should have security zones segmented well within their own network.
- Agencies should have a plan to do backups, to back up data regularly and make it secure.
- Agencies should consult guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

### Moving Forward

- Atlanta officials highlight the importance of protecting government data and information.
- The city's approach to cybersecurity now rests on three pillars:
  - Governance with compliance
  - Vulnerability management
  - Overall threat management
- To limit the financial impact of an incident or breach, a cyber-insurance policy can serve as a road map.
- An organization should step back from the smaller day-to-day tasks of enterprise-level IT management and cybersecurity to see the larger view.
- Since becoming Atlanta's CIO in October 2018, Atlanta Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley has focused on building a continuity plan.
- Wendi Whitmore, IBM's vice president of X-Force Threat Intelligence, said on this attack that running through drills can reveal critical weaknesses that allow cyberattacks to take place, as well as simple prevention efforts that can protect against extensive damage.
