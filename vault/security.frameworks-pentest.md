Best practices for security standards, baselines and frameworks:

- Used to improve the controls, methodologies and governance for the IT departments or the global behavior of the organization.
- Seeks to improve performance, controls and metrics.
- Helps to translate the business needs into technical or operational needs.

Normative and compliance:

- Rules to follow for a specific industry.
- Enforcement for the government, industry, or clients.
- Event if the company or the organization do not want to implement those controls, for compliance.

## IT Governance Process

- **Strategic and Tactic plans** - Each organization must have a set of strategic plans based on the goals objectives.
- **Policies** - Those plans are tactical and strategic enforced by policies.
- **Procedures** - Each policy may have a procedure associated with details regarding the operative process.
- **Others** - Could be other documents such as guidelines, baselines, standards and technical procedures.

IT Governance
: Defined processes that ensure the effective and efficient use of IT in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.

## Cybersecurity Compliance and Audit Overview

### Compliance and Normative

- **SOX - The Sarbanes-Oxley** Act implemented standards to improve financial transparency and protect shareholders and general public from accounting errors and fraud.
- **HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** is a series of regulatory standards that outline the lawful use and disclosure of protected health information.
- **GLBA** - Known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 that requires financial institutions to explain how they share and protect their customers' private information.
- **PCI/DDS** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance revolves around information protection, data reduction, and security.

### Audits

1. Define the audit scope and limitations
2. Look for information, gathering information
3. Do the audit (different methods).
4. Feedback based on the findings.
5. Deliver a report.
6. Discuss the results.

- Internal audits to improve the operation of the organization all year round cycle.
- External audits are based on requirements to meet compliance standards and certification.

## Penetration Testing Process and Mile 2 CPTE Training

## OWASP Framework

The [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) tests show web application security risks. The process ensures first to produce more secure code and minimize web application security risks.
