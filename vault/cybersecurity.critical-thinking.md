## Critical Thinking Model

Critical thinking is controlled, purposeful thinking directed toward a goal.

- Cybersecurity is a diverse, multifaced field.
  - Constantly changing environment
  - Fast-paced
  - Multiple stakeholders
  - Adversary presence

- Critical thinking forces us to think and act in situations where there are no clear answers nor specific procedures.

- Part Art, Part Science: Subjective and impossible to measure.

- In a world of "Google it" era, when information is widely available.
  - Sharp contrast from when books were the main source of information.
  - The wealth of information can overwhelm our reasoning abilities.
    - More data != more knowledge
  - *Critical thinking is more important than ever*.

### Cybersecurity - The Technical Skills

- *Intrusion Detection*: Reactive security - identify and mitigate malicious activity. May be network-based or host based. Ex: Snort, Suricata, Bro.

- *Reverse Engineering*: Needed for malware analysis and vulnerability research. Ex: IDA Pro (Disassembler), WinHex (Hexeditor), OllyDbg (Debugger).

- *Programming*: Useful for scripting, tools development, security research, and reverse engineering. Ex: Python, C/C++, Java, Assembly.

- *Virtualization*: Common across IT organizations - for research, lab development, and reverse engineering. Ex: VMware, VirtualBox.

- *Cryptography*: Understand and develop algorithms, ciphers, and security systems. Ex: Encryption, digital signatures, hash functions, etc.

- *Networking*: Understand networking protocols, packet sniffing, firewalls, routers, etc. Ex: TCP/IP, ICMP, Wireshark.

- *Operating Systems*: System architecture, application execution, logging details, configurations an settings.

- *Database Modeling*: Useful for threat modeling and incident investigations. Ex: Maltego, Synapse.

The reality is to understand the technology, not tools.

- **Common Misconception**: Keeping up with the latest technical tools and trends is the key to success.

- **Reality**: Tools (and the threat landscape) change quickly - it is impossible to be proficient in everything.

- **Good news**: Security and design fundamentals change slowly.

- **The Point: Critical thinking skills** and an understanding of security fundamentals will allow to identify solutions to unknown, undefined, and complex situations (regardless of technology).

## Critical Thinking - 5 Key Skills

**1 - Challenge assumptions = Question the mental model that underlies your reasoning.**

- An **assumption** is a thought that causes us to predict an outcome.
- Based on a past experience or old thoughts and evidence.
- **Challenge them!** List assumptions and then assess whether it is solid, has caveats, or is unsupported.
- Refine as your learn more and circumstances change.
- Questions are converted into **collection requirements** (I need more hard data) or **research topics** (I need more information).

1. Explicitly list all assumptions.
    - Brainstorm.
    - Invite all shareholders.
2. Examine each with key questions.
    - Why is this correct?
    - How confident am I that this is valid?
3. Categorize based on evidence.
    - Solid and well-supported.
    - Unsupported/questionable - uncertainties.
4. Refine and remove.
    - Remove assumptions that don't hold up.
    - Add new assumptions that emerge.
5. Identify additional data needs.
    - Unsupported doesn't mean invalid.
    - Consider turning them into research topics or additional data should be collected.

**2- Consider Alternative Explanations = Avoid letting yourself become entrenched in one explanation.**

- Our brains can piece together a situation with jew a few bits of data.
- Failure to consider missing data or alternatives can lead us down the wrong path.
- How?

1. Brainstorm
    - List all possibilities.
    - Go from negative to positive.
2. The 6 W's
    - Provide framework.
    - Who/what/when/where/why/how
      1. Who is involved? Who are the shareholders? Who is affected by the outcome?
      2. What is at stake? What happened? What is the problem? What is the desired outcome?
      3. Where did this take place? Where are the stakeholders? Where is the infrastructure? Does geography make a difference?
      4. When did it take place? Does timing make a difference? When are the key dates? Are there deadlines to be aware of?
      5. Why are we doing this? What are the benefits? Key drivers? Motives?
      6. (W) How will we approach this? Is it feasible? Be detailed and specific - think through each alternative.
    - Evaluate all dimensions.
3. Null Hypothesis
    - Establish the opposite of main hypothesis.
    - Useful for anomalous data.  

**3 - Evaluate Data = Assess the data against multiple hypotheses to see how well it fits.**

- **KNOW. YOUR. DATA.**
  - What does normal look like?
  - Key to anomaly detection.

- Establish a baseline for what's normal.
  - Web traffic
  - Network sensors
  - Endpoint activity
  - Source/destination
  - Volume/velocity
  - ...

- Be on the lookout for ***inconsistent data***.
- Gotcha: "Cyber" data is notoriously hard to get.
  - Policy/privacy/collection issues
  - Be proactive

**4 - Identify Key Drivers = Key drivers significantly impact a situation.**

- Technology
  - Encryption
  - Authentication
  - Tools/frameworks
  - Infrastructure availability

- Regulatory
  - Privacy
  - Intellectual Property
  - Safety regulations
  - GDPR / HIPAA / etc.

- Society
  - Politics
  - Public perception
  - Expectation to keep data secure

- Supply chain
  - Customer requirements
  - Logistics
  - Cost
  - Scheduling

- Employees
  - Employee perspective
  - Skills
  - Training needs

- Threat actors
  - Technical capability
  - Motives
  - Opportunity

**5 - Understand the Context = Understand the operational environment in which you are working.**

- Consider the perspective of your managers, colleagues, and clients.
- What do they need from me? How can I frame the issue? Do I need to place their questions in a broader context?
- Framing techniques help keep everyone on the same page.

1. *Key components* - Who or what are the key components? Break the problem down into component parts and then list key actors or categories.

2. *Factors at Play* - Identify driving forces to understand the dynamics of the situation. Break the problem into component parts to reveal additional insights or relationships.

3. *Relationships* - What patterns and relationships exist among the components and factors?

4. *Similarities/Differences* - Are there historical analogies? Similar situations can help understand and respond.

5. *Redefine* - Experiment with different ways to reframe your problem. Write down what you know, what you don't know, and rephrase or paraphrase the issue. What is the root cause?

**Problem Framing = Identifying different aspects of a problem can deliver radical improvements - and even spark solutions to seemingly complex problems.**

**Reframe the problem**
: "The elevator is too old and slow." to "Waiting is boring."

**Solution**
: "Shorten perceived wait time."
  
- Put up mirrors
- Play music
- Install art displays

"Make the elevator faster."

- Replace the lift
- Install a stronger motor
- Upgrade the lift algorithm
