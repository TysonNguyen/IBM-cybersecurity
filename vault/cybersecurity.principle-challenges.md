# Cybersecurity - A Security Architect's Perspective

- [ ] Describe who are the primary actors in cyber crime and what are the motives of each.

- [ ] Describe why comprehensive cybersecurity architecture can be very complex to implement in reality.
  - [ ] Translation of simple business requirements into technical specifications and deployment decisions can be very difficult.
  - [ ] The protection mechanism itself is subject to attack.
  - [ ] Protectors have to be right all the time. Attackers only have to be right once.

- [ ] Describe security mechanisms and what they include.

- [ ] Describe various Network Security Models.

- [ ] Describe how the destruction, corruption, modification, theft, removal, loss or disclosure of information or other resources and the interruption of service can constitute threats to the security of data or systems.

- [ ] Describe how an action taken by a human, with intent to violate security, constitutes an attack.

- [ ] Identify and classify the various forms of active and passive attacks.

- The principles of security:

  - *Confidentiality*: Only sender, intended receiver should 'understand' the message contents. Sender encrypts message and receiver decrypts message.
  
  - *Authentication*: Sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other.
  
  - *Message Integrity*: Sender, receiver want to ensure message not altered (in transit, or afterwards) without detection.
  - *Access and Availability*: Services must be accessible and available to users.

- NIST definition of Computer Security:
  
  **The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources, includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications.**

## Additional Computer Security Challenges

- Security is not as simple as it seems.
  - Easy requirements, tough solutions.
- Solutions can be attacked themselves where security policy enforcement structures as the targets.
- Protection of enforcement structure can complicate solutions.
  - Solution itself can be easy, but complicated by protection.
- Security architectural decisions on what to do but where to take action?
- Key management is difficult solution.
- Protectors have to be right all the time and attackers just once to succeed.
- No one like security until its needed (seat belt philosophy).
- Security architectures require constant effort from strategic versus tactical perspectives.
- Security is often a decision after thought.
- Security is viewed as a burden in early development life cycle of a project and not integrated right away.
