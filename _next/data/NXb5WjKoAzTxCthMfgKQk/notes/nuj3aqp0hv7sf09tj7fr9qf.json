Despite all threat models and secure system designs, incidents do happen. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the type of attack, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/ab0cc8478b0bce9a400187f559d36dd6.png\" alt=\"urgency-impact\"></p>\n<p>An incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), which is a group of employees with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident.</p>\n<p>Incident Management\n: Computer security incident management involves the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer or a computer network and the execution of proper resources to those events. Means the information security or the incident management team will regularly check and monitor the security events occurring on a computer or in our network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"key-components\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#key-components\"></a>Key Components</h3>\n<p>Events\n: An observed change to the normal behavior of a system, environment, process, workflow, or person.

A BIA (Business Impact Analysis) is also good to have a clear understanding of the critical business areas. Also indicate if a security incident will trigger the BCP or the disaster recovery.</p>\n<p>Post-Incident\n: Root-cause analysis, understand the difference between error, problem and isolated incident.
