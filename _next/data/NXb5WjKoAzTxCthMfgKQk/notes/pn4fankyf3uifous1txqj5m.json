For example, the shell operators <code>;</code>, <code>&#x26;</code>, and <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code> will combine two (or more) system commands and execute them both.</p>\n<p>Command injection can be detected in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Blind command injection</strong>: There is no direct output from the application when testing payloads. You will have to investigate the behaviors of the application to determine whether or not the payload was successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Verbose command injection</strong>: There is direct feedback from the application once you have tested a payload. For example, running the <code>whoami</code> command to see what user the application is running under.
