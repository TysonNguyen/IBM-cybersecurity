Ransomware variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert. Typically, these alerts state that the user’s systems have been locked or that the user’s files have been encrypted. Users are told that unless a ransom is paid, access will not be restored. The ransom demanded from individuals varies greatly but is frequently $200–$400 dollars and must be paid in virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-ransomware\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#types-of-ransomware\"></a>Types of Ransomware</h2>\n<h3 id=\"crypto\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#crypto\"></a>Crypto</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Encrypt the sensitive files located on the victim's computer, such as documents, pictures, or videos to prevent access until ransom is paid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"locker\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#locker\"></a>Locker</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Solely aims to lock victims out of their entire computer devices until ransom is paid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"leakwaredoxware\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#leakwaredoxware\"></a>Leakware/Doxware</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Threaten to release footage from webcam, or any incriminating files that may be on a computer.\n<ul>\n<li>May release to the public or specific people until ransom is paid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"attack-vectors\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#attack-vectors\"></a>Attack Vectors</h2>\n<p>There are many different ways a user can fall victim to a ransomware, though most can be avoided with proper security education and protocols.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phishing</li>\n<li>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</li>\n<li>Software vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>Malicious Links</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"prevention\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#prevention\"></a>Prevention</h2>\n<p>The best way to prevent being a victim of ransomware is to keep a backup of all your data, keep your software up to date and use complex passwords for your network and computer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use an anti-virus or related security software, and stay vigilant in verifying any link or attachment you click on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"backup\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#backup\"></a>Backup</h3>\n<p>Having a full backup removes the threat of losing data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"update-software--passwords\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#update-software--passwords\"></a>Update Software &#x26; Passwords</h3>\n<p>Updated software and strong passwords is the first line of defense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"antivirus\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#antivirus\"></a>Antivirus</h3>\n<p>Security software scanning for malicious attachments or changes to computer combats phishing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beware-of-links\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#beware-of-links\"></a>Beware of Links</h3>\n<p>Beyond emails, websites can be spoofed and visiting or clicking on links can download ransomware.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#examples\"></a>Examples</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A\">Infections can be devastating to an individual or organization, and recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist.

plan.</li>\n<li>Wendi Whitmore, IBM's vice president of X-Force Threat Intelligence, said on this attack that running through drills can reveal critical weaknesses that allow cyberattacks to take place, as well as simple prevention efforts that can protect against extensive
