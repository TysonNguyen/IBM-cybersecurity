Anything that falls outside of the agreement is deemed unauthorized. Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. The discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.</p>\n<p>Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation. For example, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK. This check means that only <em>\"CHECK approved companies can conduct authorized penetration tests of public sector and CNI systems and networks.\"</em> (NCSC).</p>\n<p>Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal; it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.</p>\n<p>Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Hat Category</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>White Hat</td><td>Considered 'good' people.
