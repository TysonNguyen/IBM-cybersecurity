The attackers surreptitiously gained access to Target’s computer network, stole the financial and personal information of as many as 110 million Target customers, and then removed this sensitive information from Target’s network to a server in Eastern Europe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John Mulligan, Target’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, testified that his company “had in place multiple layers of protection, including firewalls, malware detection software, intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and data loss prevention tools.”38 He further stated that Target had been certified in September 2013 as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), 39 which credit card companies require before allowing merchants to process credit and debit card payments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Kill Chain\" Analysis of the 2013 Target Data Breach; Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3
