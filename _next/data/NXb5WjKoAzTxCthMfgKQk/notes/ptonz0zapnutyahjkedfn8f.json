It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let or const keywords.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>let x</code> // declares the variable x and assigns to it the special value \"undefined\".</li>\n<li><code>let y = 2;</code> // declares the variable y and assigns to it the value 2.</li>\n<li><code>let z = \"Hello, World!\";</code> // declares the variable z and assigns to it a string containing \"Hello, World!\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bash\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#bash\"></a>Bash</h3>\n<p>Bash\n: GNU Bash or simply bash is Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS Mojave and earlier versions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.</li>\n<li>Supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.</li>\n<li>Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token shebang important\">#!/bin/bash</span>\n<span class=\"token assign-left variable\">myvariable</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span>Hello\n<span class=\"token assign-left variable\">anothervar</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span>Fred\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$myvariable</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$anothervar</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span>\n<span class=\"token assign-left variable\">sampledir</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span>/etc\n<span class=\"token function\">ls</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$sampledir</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"perl\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#perl\"></a>Perl</h3>\n<p>Perl\n: Larry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, while working as a programmer at Unisys, and released version 1.0 to the comp.sources.misc newsgroup on December 18, 1987.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perl 2, released in 1988, featured a better regular expression engine.</li>\n<li>Perl 3, released in 1989, added support for binary data streams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Originally, the only documentation for Perl was a single lengthy man page. In 1991, Programming Perl, known to many Perl programmers as the \"Camel Book\" because of its cover, was published and became the reference for the language.</p>\n<p>Perl variables do not have to be explicitly declared to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to a variables.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>$age = 25; # An integer assignment</code></li>\n<li><code>$name = \"John Paul\"; # A string</code></li>\n<li><code>$salary = 1445.50; # A floating point</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"powershell\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#powershell\"></a>PowerShell</h3>\n<p>PowerShell\n: A task automation and configuration management from Microsoft, consisting of command-line shell and associated scripting language. Initially, a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core. The former is built on .NET Framework while the latter on .NET Core.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the file system or registry, which are made available to PowerShell via providers. Third-party developers can add cmdlets and providers to PowerShell. Cmdlets may be used by scripts and scripts may be packaged into modules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"binary\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#binary\"></a>Binary</h3>\n<p>Binary\n: Code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. Often \"0\" and \"1\" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc. A binary string of eight bights can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In computing and telecommunications, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width strings. In fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that big string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"hex\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#hex\"></a>Hex</h3>\n<p>Hex\n: Advanced hex editors have scripting systems that let the user create macro like functionality as a sequence of user interface commands for automating common tasks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be used for providing scripts that automatically patch files (e.g., game cheating, modding, or product fixes provided by community) or to write more complex/intelligent templates.</li>\n<li>Scripting languages vary widely, often being product specific languages resembling MS-DOS batch files, to systems that support fully-fledged scripting languages such as Lua or Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a
