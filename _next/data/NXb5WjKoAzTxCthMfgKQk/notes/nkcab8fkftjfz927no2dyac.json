To prevent or mitigate the severity of a third-party data breach or cyber exploit, organizations can implement a variety of cybersecurity risk management controls such as assessing compliance with regulations, vetting third-party security practices and establishing data breach and cyber exploit incident response procedures.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"industry-quick-facts\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\"
