## Cyber Kill Chain

Cyber Kill Chain
: A security model that outlines the phases of a cyberattack.

![Kill Chain](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/cyber-kill-chain-infographic-100741032-large.jpg)

1. **Reconnaissance**: Research, identification, and selection of targets.
2. **Weaponization**: Pairing remote access malware with exploit into a deliverable payload (e.g Adobe PDF and Microsoft Office files).
3. **Delivery**: Transmission of weapon to target (e.g via email attachments, websites, or USB drives).
4. **Exploitation**: Once delivered, the weapon's code is triggered, exploiting vulnerable applications or systems.
5. **Installation**: The weapon installs a backdoor on a target's system allowing persistent access.
6. **Command & Control**: Outside server communicates with the weapons providing "hands on keyboard access" inside the target's network.
7. **Actions on Objectives**: The attacker works to achieve the objective of the intrusion, which can include exfiltration or destruction of data, or intrusion of another target.

## Social Engineering

The use of humans for cyber purposes.

- Communicate the with the intended victim to extract useful information for an attack.
- Attacker will attempt to manipulate to encourage the victim to give away sensitive information.

### Phishing and Vishing

- Vishing utilize voice communication conducted over voice and phone calls.
  - VoIP allows caller identity to be spoofed.
- Phishing attacks use email or malicious websites to impetrate personal information by acting as a trustworthy organization.

## Cyberwarfare

Cyberwarfare
: Use of computer technology to disrupt the activities of a state or organization, especially the purpose attacking of information systems for strategic or military purposes.

## X-Force Research

As threats multiply and increase in sophistication, it is more important than ever that organizations maintain awareness of current security trends.

IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence research reports can help you keep pace with an evolving threat landscape and learn how to protect your networks and data from the latest threats and attack vectors. Current reports are available for download, using the links below.

In 2018, many organizations across all industries faced unmanageable levels of cyber threats brought on by the changing threat landscape, the risk of exposure, and an ever-growing attack surface. The optimum strategy to respond to this combination of factors is to make security an integral part of culture and overall structure. To help organizations better prepare for this landscape, IBM® Security has developed the X-Force® Threat Intelligence Index 2019 report to provide insight on cybersecurity issues, including what the most common types of attacks are and where they come from.

The IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2019 examined numerous cyber threats that shaped the threat landscape in 2018 and will continue to have an impact in 2019. According to the report, cyber-criminals are moving away from malware-based attacks and instead abusing operating system tools to achieve their goals.

Download the full IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2019 to discover how to keep pace with the changing threat landscape and:

    - Analyze top targeted industries and changes year over year

    - Explore how cyber criminals are using operating system tools to get control

    - Uncover why cyber criminals are changing their techniques to gain illegal profits

    - Determine what steps you can take to protect your organization against these threats

IBM Security analyzes data and insight derived from monitored security clients, incident response services and penetration testing engagements. X-Force also runs spam traps around the world and monitors tens of millions of spam and phishing attacks daily. It analyzes billions of web pages and images to detect fraudulent activity and brand abuse

Download the 2019 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2019 if you have not already done so from the resource section of a previous lesson.  Read the report and keep as a reference guide throughout your Cybersecurity training.
