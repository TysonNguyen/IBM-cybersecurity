<blockquote>
<p>Vulnerability scanning identifies hosts and host attributes (e.g. operating systems, applications, open ports), but it also attempts to identify vulnerabilities rather than relying on human interpretation of the scanning results... Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization's security policy. - NIST-SP 800-115</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability-scanner"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vulnerability-scanner"></a>Vulnerability Scanner</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeping an up-to-date database of vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Detection of genuine vulnerabilities without an excessive number of false positives.</li>
<li>Ability to conduct multiple scans at the same time.</li>
<li>Ability to perform trend analyses and create clear reports of the results.</li>
<li>Provide recommendations for effective countermeasures to eliminate discovered vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="components-of-vulnerability-scanners"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#components-of-vulnerability-scanners"></a>Components of Vulnerability Scanners</h3>
<p>There are 4 main components of most scanners:</p>
<p>Engine Scanner
: Performs security checks according to its installed plug-ins, identifying system information, and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Database
: Stores vulnerability information, scan results, and other data used by the scanner.</p>
<p>Report Module
: Provides scan result reporting such as technical reports for system administrators, summary reports for security managers, and high-level graph and trend reports for corporate executives' leadership.</p>
<p>User Interface
: Allows the administrator to operate the scanner. It may be either a Graphical User Interface (GUI), or just a command line interface.</p>

<h4 id="internal"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#internal"></a>Internal</h4>
<ul>
<li>It can be through Malware or virus that is downloaded onto a network through internet or USB.</li>
<li>It can be a disgruntled employee who has the internal network access.</li>
<li>It can be through the outside attacker who has gained the access to the internal network.</li>
<li>The internal scan is done by running the vulnerability scanner on the critical components of the network from a machine which is a part of the network. This important component may include core router, switches, workstations, web server, database,etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="external"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#external"></a>External</h4>
<ul>
<li>External scan is important as it is required to detect the vulnerabilities to those internet facing assets through which an attacker can gain internal access.
<ul>
<li>Running a vulnerability scanner on the host from the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always a good idea to eliminate the open issues/loopholes before it can be used and exploited by a malicious user or an attacker.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-vulnerability-scoring-system-cvss"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#common-vulnerability-scoring-system-cvss"></a>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</h3>
<p>A method of assigning severity rankings to computer system vulnerabilities, ranging from zero (least severe) to 10 (most severe).</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a standardized vulnerability score across the industry, helping critical information flow more effectively between sections within an organization and between organizations.</li>
<li>The formula for determining the score is public and freely distributed, providing transparency.</li>
<li>Helps prioritize risk - CVSS rankings provide both a general score and more specific metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="score-breakdown"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#score-breakdown"></a>Score Breakdown</h4>
<p>Base-Exploit score
: Gives an idea of how easy it is to exploit the vulnerability and how much damage an exploit targeting that vulnerability could inflict.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack vector</li>
<li>Attack complexity</li>
<li>Privileges required</li>
<li>User interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Temporal score
: Ranks how aware people are of the vulnerability, what remedial steps are being taken, and whether threat actors are targeting it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploit code maturity</li>
<li>Remediation level</li>
<li>Report confidence</li>
</ul>
<p>Environmental score
: Provides a more customized metric specific to an organization or work environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security requirements</li>
<li>Impact score</li>

<h3 id="security-technical-implementation-guides-stigs"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#security-technical-implementation-guides-stigs"></a>Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is the entity responsible for maintaining the security posture of the Department of Defense (DoD) IT infrastructure.</li>
<li>Default configurations for many applications are inadequate in terms of security, and developing a security standard for applications would allow various DoD agencies to utilize the same standard across all application instances that exist.</li>
<li>STIGs exist for a variety of software packages including Operating Systems, Database Applications, Open Source Software, Network Devices, Wireless Devices, Virtual Software, and the list continues to grow including mobile operating systems.</li>

<li>CIS Benchmarks are the only consensus-based, best-practice security configuration guides both developed and accepted by government, business, industry, and academia.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="controls"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#controls"></a>Controls</h4>
<p>CIS Controls are prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>5 critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system in the CIS Controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offense informs defense</li>
<li>Prioritization</li>
<li>Measurements and Metrics</li>
<li>Continuous diagnostics and mitigation</li>
<li>Automation</li>
