## Threat Intelligence Overview

Cyber threat intelligence is information about threats and threat actors that helps mitigate harmful events in cyberspace.

Cyber threat intelligence provides a number of benefits, including:

- Empowers organizations to develop a proactive cybersecurity posture and to bolster overall risk management policies.
- Drives momentum toward a cybersecurity posture that is predictive, not just reactive.
- Enables improved detection of threats.
- Informs better decision-making during and following the detection of cyber intrusion.

Cost of breach report in 2019 is now 3.92 million, with an average size of more than 25,000 records in each data breach.

- Average cost has increased from $493,000 to over $871,000 in 2019.

## Strategy and External Sources

CrowdStrike looks at three intelligence areas that organizations and security analyst should be aware of.

Tactical (Mechanic)
: Focused on performing malware analysis & enrichment, as well as ingesting atomic, static, and behavioral threat indicators into defensive cybersecurity systems.

- SOC Analyst
- SIEM
- Firewall
- Endpoints
- IDS/IPS

Operational (Race Car Driver)
: Focused on understanding adversarial capabilities, infrastructure, & TTPs, and then leveraging that understanding to conduct more targeted and prioritized cybersecurity operations.

- Threat Hunter
- SOC Analyst
- Vulnerability Management
- Incident Response
- Insider Threat

Strategic (The Owner)
: Focused on understanding high level trends and adversarial motives, and then leveraging that understanding to engage in strategic security and business decision-making.

#### Threat Intelligence Strategy Map

1. Collect (Integrate data)
   - Multiple sources:
     - Internal, External
     - Technical, Human
     - Raw, Packaged

2. Process (Put data in context)
   - Normal
   - Correlate
   - Confirm
   - Enrich

3. Analyze (Find insight and actions)
   - Investigate
   - Contain
   - Remediate
   - Prioritize

4. Share (Inform decisions)
   - Who, for what purpose
   - What, how often
   - What format / medium

#### Sharing Threat Intelligence

> In practice, successful Threat Intelligence initiatives generate insights and actions that can help to inform the decision - both tactical, and strategic - of multiple people and teams, throughout your organization. - Threat Intelligence Strategy Map: From Technical Activities to Business Value
