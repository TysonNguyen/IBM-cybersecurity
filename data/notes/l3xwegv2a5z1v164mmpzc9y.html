<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A">Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computer systems, restricting users’ access to the infected systems. Ransomware variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert. Typically, these alerts state that the user’s systems have been locked or that the user’s files have been encrypted. Users are told that unless a ransom is paid, access will not be restored. The ransom demanded from individuals varies greatly but is frequently $200–$400 dollars and must be paid in virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.</a></p>

<li>Solely aims to lock victims out of their entire computer devices until ransom is paid.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="leakwaredoxware"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#leakwaredoxware"></a>Leakware/Doxware</h3>
<ul>
<li>Threaten to release footage from webcam, or any incriminating files that may be on a computer.
<ul>
<li>May release to the public or specific people until ransom is paid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attack-vectors"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#attack-vectors"></a>Attack Vectors</h2>
<p>There are many different ways a user can fall victim to a ransomware, though most can be avoided with proper security education and protocols.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phishing</li>
<li>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</li>
<li>Software vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Malicious Links</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prevention"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#prevention"></a>Prevention</h2>
<p>The best way to prevent being a victim of ransomware is to keep a backup of all your data, keep your software up to date and use complex passwords for your network and computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an anti-virus or related security software, and stay vigilant in verifying any link or attachment you click on.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backup"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#backup"></a>Backup</h3>
<p>Having a full backup removes the threat of losing data.</p>
<h3 id="update-software--passwords"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#update-software--passwords"></a>Update Software &#x26; Passwords</h3>
<p>Updated software and strong passwords is the first line of defense.</p>
<h3 id="antivirus"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#antivirus"></a>Antivirus</h3>
<p>Security software scanning for malicious attachments or changes to computer combats phishing.</p>
<h3 id="beware-of-links"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#beware-of-links"></a>Beware of Links</h3>
<p>Beyond emails, websites can be spoofed and visiting or clicking on links can download ransomware.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#examples"></a>Examples</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A">Infections can be devastating to an individual or organization, and recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the encrypted files will be released; it only guarantees that the malicious actors receive the victim’s money, and in some cases, their banking information. In addition, decrypting files does not mean the malware infection itself has been removed.</a></p>
<h3 id="why-it-is-effective"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-it-is-effective"></a>Why it is Effective</h3>
<p>The authors of ransomware instill fear and panic into their victims, causing them to click on a link or pay a ransom, and users systems can become infected with additional malware.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Your computer was used to visit websites with illegal content. To unlock your computer, you must pay a $100 fine.”</li>
<li>“Your computer has been infected with a virus. Click here to resolve the issue.”</li>
<li>“All files on your computer have been encrypted. You must pay this ransom within 72 hours to regain access to your data.”</li>

<h3 id="vulnerabilities"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vulnerabilities"></a>Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>There was no plan in place if an attack occurred.</p>
<h4 id="operations-during-an-attack"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#operations-during-an-attack"></a>Operations During an Attack</h4>
<p>Despite the breach, Atlanta's 911 system and its emergency response was unaffected, and major utilities including water and sewer services continued.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retained the manual processes and institutional knowledge needed to revert to traditional methods of service provision and had plans in place to keep doing business during the attack.</li>
<li>Did not understand the impact of the threat on all operations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="readiness-of-systems"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#readiness-of-systems"></a>Readiness of Systems</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lack of spending upgrading their infrastructure.</li>
<li>Large number of vulnerabilities logged in a January 2018 audit.
<ul>
<li>Found 1,500 to 2,000 vulnerabilities in the city systems, and suggested that the number of vulnerabilities had so large that workers grew complacent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cost"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cost"></a>Cost</h3>
<ul>
<li>The attack could cost taxpayers $17 million - up from earlier estimates of 2.7 million.</li>
<li>The latest cost estimate includes about $6 million in existing contracts for security services and software upgrades and 11 million in potential costs associated with the attack, including new desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets.</li>
<li>This would mark one of the U.S.' costliest cyberattacks affecting a local government in 2018, despite city officials declining to pay the ransom demanding by the hackers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prevention-1"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#prevention-1"></a>Prevention</h3>
<ul>
<li>IT officials must know their network architecture, invest in email infrastructure, and remain vigilant at all levels, scrutinizing emails and their attachments and looking for browser vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication is immensely valuable and segmentation is crucial.</li>
<li>State and local governments should have security zones segmented well within their own network.</li>
<li>Agencies should have a plan to do backups, to back up data regularly and make it secure.</li>
<li>Agencies should consult guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moving-forward"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#moving-forward"></a>Moving Forward</h3>
<ul>
<li>Atlanta officials highlight the importance of protecting government data and information.</li>
<li>The city's approach to cybersecurity now rests on three pillars:
<ul>
<li>Governance with compliance</li>
<li>Vulnerability management</li>
<li>Overall threat management</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To limit the financial impact of an incident or breach, a cyber-insurance policy can serve as a road map.</li>
<li>An organization should step back from the smaller day-to-day tasks of enterprise-level IT management and cybersecurity to see the larger view.</li>
<li>Since becoming Atlanta's CIO in October 2018, Atlanta Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley has focused on building a continuity plan.</li>
<li>Wendi Whitmore, IBM's vice president of X-Force Threat Intelligence, said on this attack that running through drills can reveal critical weaknesses that allow cyberattacks to take place, as well as simple prevention efforts that can protect against extensive damage.</li>
