<hr>
<p>There are two major types of attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Passive Attacks</strong> are essentially eavesdropping styles of attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Benefits is not easy detectable so eavesdropping could occur for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no evidence messages or evidence is being intercepted or changed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second class is traffic analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Active Attacks</strong> are explicit interception and modification. The attacker attempts to alter or control data and/or the hardware it resides on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Several classes of these attacks exist.
<ul>
<li><em>Masquerade</em> - Imitating someone else's identity and using legitimate sources to carry out attacks in the victim's name.</li>
<li><em>Replay</em> - Intercept communications and then fraudulently delays or resend it to misdirect the receiver into doing what the hacker wants.</li>
<li><em>Modification</em> - Tampering with the asset or message.</li>
<li><em>Denial of Service</em> - Deny users to access information systems, devices, or other network resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security-services"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#security-services"></a>Security Services</h2>
<p><em>Security services</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A processing or communication service that is provided by a system.</li>
<li>To give a specific kind of protection to a system resource.</li>
<li>Security services implement security policies.</li>
<li>Are implemented by security mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The purpose of a security service</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance security data processing systems and information transfer of an organization.</li>
<li>Intended to counter security attacks.</li>
<li>Using one or more security mechanisms.</li>
<li>Often replicates functions normally associated with physical documents.
<ul>
<li>For example, have signatures, dates; need protection from disclosure, tampering, or destruction; be notarized or witnessed; be recorded or licensed.</li>

<h2 id="security-mechanisms"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#security-mechanisms"></a>Security Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Security mechanisms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combination of hardware, software, and processes.</li>
<li>They implement a specific security policy.
<ul>
<li>Protocol suppression, ID and authentication, for example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mechanisms use security services to enforce security policy.</li>
<li>Business policy describes what to going to do - Not how they are doing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security mechanisms from X.800:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Specific</strong> security mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cryptography</li>

<p>This model requires us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design a suitable algorithm for the security transformation.</li>
<li>Generate the secret information (keys) used by the algorithm.</li>
<li>Develop methods to distribute and share the secret information.</li>
<li>Specify a protocol enabling the principals to use the transformation and secret information for a security service.</li>

<p>A.2.2
: The motivation for security in open systems.</p>
<p>CCITT has identified a need for a series of Recommendations to enhance security within the Open Systems Interconnection architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Society's increasing dependence on computers that are accessed by, or linked by, data communications and which require protection against various threats.</li>
<li>The appearance in several countries of "data protection" legislation which obliges suppliers to demonstrate system integrity and privacy.</li>
<li>The wish of various organizations to use OSI recommendations, enhanced as needed, for existing and future secure systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>A.2.3
: What is to be protected?</p>
<p>In general, the following may require protection:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Information</em> and <em>data</em> (including software and passive data related to security measures such as passwords).</li>
<li>Communication and data processing <em>services</em>.</li>
<li><em>Equipment</em> and <em>facilities</em>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="organizational-threats"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#organizational-threats"></a>Organizational Threats</h2>
<p>Threats to a data communication system include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Destruction</strong> of information and/or other resources;</li>
<li><strong>Corruption</strong> or <strong>modification</strong> of information;</li>
<li><strong>Theft</strong>, <strong>removal</strong> or <strong>loss</strong> of information and/or other resources;</li>
<li><strong>Disclosure</strong> of information; and</li>
<li><strong>Interruption</strong> of services.</li>
</ul>
<p>More on threats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accidental</strong> threats do not involve malicious intent.</li>
<li><strong>Intentional</strong> threats require human with intent to violate security.
<ul>
<li>If an intentional threat results in action, it becomes an <strong>attack</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Passive</strong> threats do not involve any (non-trivial) change to a system.</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong> threats involve some significant change to a system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attacks"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#attacks"></a>Attacks</h2>
<p>An attack is an action by a human with intent to violate security. It does not matter if the attack succeeds. It is still considered an attack even if it fails.</p>
<h3 id="2-forms-of-passive-attacks"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#2-forms-of-passive-attacks"></a>2 Forms of Passive Attacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Disclosure</strong> (release of message contents)
: The content of a message is revealed to the unauthorized parties. An attack on the <em>confidentiality</em> of a message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic analysis</strong> (or traffic flow analysis). Even if an opponent cannot read the message content, information about the message may be useful information to the opponent. Also an attack on the <em>confidentiality</em> of the message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-forms-of-passive-attacks"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#4-forms-of-passive-attacks"></a>4 Forms of Passive Attacks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masquerade</strong>
: An opponent impersonates a known or authorized person or system. This is an attack on the <em>authentication</em> of the authorized entity's <em>identity</em>. An attack on the <em>authentication</em> of the <em>origin</em> of the message.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-architecture-attacks"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#security-architecture-attacks"></a>Security Architecture Attacks</h2>
<p><strong>Replay</strong>
: A copy of legitimate message is captured by an opponent and re-transmitted. This is an attack on the <em>integrity</em> of the system's data.</p>
<p><strong>Modification</strong>
: The content of a legitimate message is altered. This is an attack on the <em>integrity</em> of the message.</p>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong>
: An opponent prevents authorized users from accessing a system. This is an attack on the <em>availability</em> of the system.</p>

<p>Normally, information flows directly from the source to the destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>The information never arrives at the destination = <em>Active Attack (denial of service)</em>.</li>
<li>The information arrives but an opponent obtains a copy = <em>Passive attack (disclosure).</em></li>
<li>An opponent intercepts the original message and forwards a modified version that appears to come from the original source = <em>Active attack (masquerade).</em></li>
<li>An opponent creates a message which appears to have come from the legitimate source = <em>Active attack (masquerade, denial of service).</em></li>
<li>The message never arrives at the destination but an opponent obtains a copy = <em>Active attack (denial of service).</em></li>
