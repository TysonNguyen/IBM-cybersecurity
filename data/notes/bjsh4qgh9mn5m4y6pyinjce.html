<p>The importance an relevancy of cybersecurity are increasing and be in every walk of life. Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect emails or to businesses and other organizations needing to protect both devices and data from damages.</p>
<ul>
<li>A penetration test or pentest is ethically-driven attempt to test and analyze the security defenses to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.</li>
<li>According to <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds">Security Magazine</a>, a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ethics"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ethics"></a>Ethics</h2>
<p>A penetration test is an <strong>authorized audit</strong> of a computer system's security and defenses as agreed by the owners of the systems. Anything that falls outside of the agreement is deemed unauthorized. Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. The discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.</p>
<p>Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation. For example, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK. This check means that only <em>"CHECK approved companies can conduct authorized penetration tests of public sector and CNI systems and networks."</em> (NCSC).</p>
<p>Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal; it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.</p>
<p>Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into.</p>

























<table><thead><tr><th>Hat Category</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>White Hat</td><td>Considered 'good' people. They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.</td><td>Performing an authorized engagement on a company.</td></tr><tr><td>Grey Hat</td><td>Use their skills to benefits others; they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.</td><td>Someone taking down a scamming site.</td></tr><tr><td>Black Hat</td><td>Criminals and often seek to damage organizations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.</td><td>Ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="rules-of-engagement-roe"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#rules-of-engagement-roe"></a>Rules of Engagement (ROE)</h3>
<p>The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement - responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out.</p>





















<table><thead><tr><th>Section</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Permission</td><td>Document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activities carried out.</td></tr><tr><td>Test Scope</td><td>Annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. The test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.</td></tr><tr><td>Rules</td><td>Define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. May specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM attacks are okay.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2 id="penetration-testing-methodologies"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#penetration-testing-methodologies"></a>Penetration Testing Methodologies</h2>
<p>Penetration tests can have a wide variety of objectives and targets within scope. No penetration test is the same, and there are no one-case fits all.</p>
<p>The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology. There are general theme of the following stages:</p>





























<table><thead><tr><th>Stage</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Information Gathering</td><td>Involves collecting as much public accessible information about a target/organization as possible (Does not involve scanning any systems).</td></tr><tr><td>Enumeration/Scanning</td><td>Involves discovering applications and services running on the systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Exploitation</td><td>Leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.</td></tr><tr><td>Privilege Escalation</td><td>Once exploited, this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. Can escalate horizontally and vertically.</td></tr><tr><td>Post-exploitation</td><td>What other hosts can be targeted, additional information can we gather from the host, covering tracks and reporting</td></tr></tbody></table>

<ol>
<li><strong>Information Gathering</strong> - The most important part to outline the logistics of the test, expectation, legal implications, objectives and goals to achieve.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Modeling</strong> - Identify vulnerabilities in the network begins with  automated scans and manual testing techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Analysis</strong> - Involves documenting analysis of vulnerabilities discovered as a result of previous penetration testing techniques. The plan of attack is developed by making a list of attractive vulnerabilities, suspicious services, and items worth researching for further analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation</strong> - Carry out the vulnerability's exploit in an effort to be certain if the vulnerability is truly exploitable.</li>
<li><strong>Post Exploitation</strong> - Once a system has been compromised, the value of the actual data is determined by what is stored and how far the attacker is wiling to make use of it for malicious purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Most critical aspect to document recommendation from testing to have an opportunity to review the findings to improve security.</li>
