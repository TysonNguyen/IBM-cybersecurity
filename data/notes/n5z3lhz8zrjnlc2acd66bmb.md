## Permissions and Owners

![Permissions](http://linux-blog.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/permissions.png)

- There are three groups that can "own" a file.
  - User, group, everybody.
- For each group, there are also three types of permissions: Read, Write, Execute.
- Read: 4 (100), Write: 2 (010), Execute: 1 (001).

Change owner and group owner of a file with the `chown` command.
