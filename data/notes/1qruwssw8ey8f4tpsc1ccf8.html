<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation">In December 2013, a data breach of Target's systems affected up to 110 million customers. Compromised customer information included names, phone numbers, email and mailing addresses. In March 2015, Target reached a class-action settlement with affected consumers for $10 million (plus class-action attorney fees).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation#Customer_privacy">In May 2016, Target settled with affected banks and credit unions for 39 million (class- action attorney fees), of which $19 million would be disbursed by a MasterCard program.</a> - Wikipedia</p>
<h3 id="situation"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#situation"></a>Situation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In November and December 2013, cyber thieves executed a successful cyber attack against Target, one of the largest retail companies in the United States. The attackers surreptitiously gained access to Target’s computer network, stole the financial and personal information of as many as 110 million Target customers, and then removed this sensitive information from Target’s network to a server in Eastern Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John Mulligan, Target’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, testified that his company “had in place multiple layers of protection, including firewalls, malware detection software, intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and data loss prevention tools.”38 He further stated that Target had been certified in September 2013 as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), 39 which credit card companies require before allowing merchants to process credit and debit card payments.</p>

<p>Watering Hole
: The attacker compromises a site likely to be visited by a particular target group, rather than attacking the target group directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>July 2012, several high-profile institutions in the financial and technology sectors were victimized by a 'watering hole' attack.</li>
<li>July 13-15, 2012 - Customers of the bank are redirected to a malicious download site when they visit to do their online banking.</li>
<li>July 15-18, 2012 - Infections are detected at several companies.</li>

<h3 id="host-response"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#host-response"></a>Host Response</h3>
<p>After being infected, compromised hosts made contact with a remote command and control server in China.</p>
<ul>
<li>Infected machines attempt to communicate with one of two Chinese command and control (C&#x26;C) servers, 58.64.155.57 and 58.64.155.59, on ports 53, 80, and 443.</li>
<li>If communications are successfully established, the C&#x26;C server gains complete, real-time control of a system on the protected network.</li>
<li>The malware, a remote access Trojan, allows a remote attack to access data, log system activity, capture key logs, take screenshots, activate the system's camera, and record from the system's microphone.
<ul>
<li>The remote attacker can also drop additional downloads and programs on the controlled machine, and use it as a launching point for further attacks.</li>

<p>The infected machine becomes the new launch point of deepening the penetration.</p>
<ul>
<li>The infected machine 'legitimately' distributes more malware inside the enterprise network to gain a stronger foothold if detected.</li>
<li>The malware's first goal is to obtain privileged user identities, which it then uses to gain access to valuable assets inside the enterprise network.</li>
<li>Most attacks use ports and scans that typically are not executed from either the infected machines or user IDs.</li>
<li>After valuable assets are found, they are slowly exfiltrated to not raise any suspicion.</li>
