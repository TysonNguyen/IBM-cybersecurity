<p>Scammers stole over $100 million from Facebook and Google in a creative way. They emailed the tech giant, and asked for it. The scheme included setting up fake business and sending phishing emails to employees of Facebook and Google. The scheme ultimately duped those multi-billion dollar companies out of more than 100 million dollars in total between 2013 and 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern District of New York.</p>
