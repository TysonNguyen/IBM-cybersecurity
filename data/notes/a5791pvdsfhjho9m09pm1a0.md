## CIA Triad

### Confidentiality

Used to prevent any disclosure of data without prior authorization by the owner (privacy).

- Can force confidentiality with encryption.
- Elements such as authentication, access controls, physical security and permissions are normally used to enforce confidentiality.

### Integrity

Implemented to verify and validate if the information that we sent or received has not been modified by an unauthorized person of the system.

- Can implement technical controls such as mathematical algorithms or hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc.)

### Availability

The basic principle is to be sure that the information and data is always available when needed.

Technical implementations to make sure data is available:

- RAIDs
- Clusters
- ISP Redundancy
- Backups

## Non-Repudiation and CIA

Valid proof of the identity of the data sender or receiver is not altered.

Technical implementations:

- Digital signatures (on emails)
- Logs (email server)
