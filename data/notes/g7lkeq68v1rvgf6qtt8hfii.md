Scammers stole over $100 million from Facebook and Google in a creative way. They emailed the tech giant, and asked for it. The scheme included setting up fake business and sending phishing emails to employees of Facebook and Google. The scheme ultimately duped those multi-billion dollar companies out of more than 100 million dollars in total between 2013 and 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern District of New York.

## Timeline

1. Prosecutors accused Rimasauskas in 2016 of incorporating a company that posed as another company, Taiwan-based Quanta Computer - which actually does business with Facebook and Google.
2. Rimasauskas served as the '"sole member of the board of directors" of the fake company.
3. Starting in 2013, Rimasauskas and his co-conspirators created fairly convincing forgery emails using fake email accounts.
4. They sent phishing emails with fake invoices to employees at Facebook and Google.
5. Rimasauskas' work also involved "forged invoices, contracts, and letters that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents" of the companies he was impersonating.
6. The scam took $98 million from Facebook in 2015. Rimasauskas extracted 23 million from Google.

## Vulnerabilities

Even tech giants like Google and Facebook were susceptible to a targeted phishing attack.

### Spear Phishing

This type of attack targets specific users or groups, in this case the finance team.

### Systems

The tough part about this attack was that all the systems were bypassed.

### People

Given the large transactions this team was used to facilitating, these requests were not unusual.

### Delayed Response

~100 million in payments was taken from Facebook and Google due to lack of detection.

## Cost

- The scam took $98 million from Facebook in 2015. The attacker extracted 23 million from Google.
- Both companies have recovered most of that money since the scheme was discovered and the ring leader was arrested.
- He was sentenced to 30 years in July 2019.

## Prevention

- Early detection
- Review invoices and payment-related communications
- Create payment processes
- Implement two-factor authentication
- Email system automation
- Employee education/training
- SPAM filter
- Critical patches
- Antivirus
- Encryption
