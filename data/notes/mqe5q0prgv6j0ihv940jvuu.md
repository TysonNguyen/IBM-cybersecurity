## Definitions

Security Event
: An event on a system or network detected by a security device or application.

Security Attack
: A security event that has been identified by correlation and analytics tools such as malicious activity that is attempting to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information system resources or the information itself.

Security Incident
: An attack or security event that has been reviewed by IBM security analysts and deemed worthy of deeper investigation.

### Challenges

There are always going to be challenges with roughly 82 million events in 2014, which 12,000 each represented an actual attack.

- 45% of all bad guys are outsiders
- 55% represent insiders within the organization.
  - Malicious insiders
  - Inadvertent actors and mistakes.
  - Require security protocols, controls, tooling, and processes in place to address the different types of security incidences.

## Compliance Basics - Security, Privacy and Compliance

Understanding some of the differences between security and privacy and compliance standards and regulations.

### Security

- Designed protection from theft or damage, disruption or misdirection.
- Physical controls - for the servers in the data centers.
- Technical controls:
  - Features and functions of the service (e.g. encryption).
  - What log data is collected.
- Operational controls:
  - How a server is configured, updated, monitored and patched.

### Privacy

- How information is used, who that information is shared with, or if that information is used to track users.

### Compliance

- Tests that security measures are in place.
- Which and how many depend on the specific compliance.
- Often will cover additional non-security requirements such as business practices, vendor agreements, organizational controls, etc.

#### Foundational

General specifications, (not specific to any industry) important, but generally not legally required. Ex. SOC, ISO.

#### Industry

Specific to an industry, or dealing with a specific type of data. Often legal requirements. Ex. HIPAA, PCI DSS.

#### Compliance Process

Establish scope &rarr; Readiness Assessment &rarr; Gap Remediation &rarr; Testing/Auditing &rarr; Management Assertion & Reporting

- Scoping
  - "Controls" are based on the goal/compliance 50-500.
  - Ensure all components in scope are compliant to technical controls.
  - Ensure all processes are compliant to operational controls.

- Testing and auditing
  - Internal/Self assessments
  - External audit
- Audit re-certification schedules can be quarterly, bi-quarterly, annually, etc.

- Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA 2014).

FISMA assigns specific responsibilities to federal agencies, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in order to strengthen information security systems.

- Requires protection of the sensitive data created, stored, or accessed by the Federal Government or any entity on behalf of the Federal Government.

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Overview

Focus on the **cybersecurity** and **privacy**.

NIST's cybersecurity and privacy activities strengthen the security of the digital environment. NIST's sustained outreach efforts support the effective application of standards and best practices enabling the adoption of practical cybersecurity and privacy.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Laws governed at privacy of European data that focus on *compliance*, *data protection*, and *personal data*.

- The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on 25 May 2018 and presents the biggest change in data privacy in two decades.

## International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2700x

- The ISO 2700 family of standards helps organizations help information assets secure.
- ISO/IEC 27001 is the best-know standard in the family providing requirements for an information security management system (ISMS).
  - The standard provides requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system.
- Also becoming more common ISO 270018 Privacy
- Others based on industry/application, e.g. - ISO 270017 Cloud Security.

- ISO 27001 Certification can provide credibility to a client of an organization.
- For some industries, certification is a legal or contractual requirement.
- ISO develops the standards but does not issue certifications.
- Organizations that meet the requirements may be certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit.
