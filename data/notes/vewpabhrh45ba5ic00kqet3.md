## Application Security Fundamentals

> Application security encompasses measures taken to improve the security of an application often by finding, fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities. Different techniques are used to surface such security vulnerabilities at different stages of an applications lifecycle such as design, development, upgrade, and maintenance.

### Network Security vs Application Security

Network security is the protection of systems and information assets at the network level involving areas such as routers / switches, servers, workstations, and wireless networks.

Application security is the protection of application front ends, source code, and information assets at the software level involving systems such as website, databases, mobile apps, and client and server applications.

- Both network security and application security are components of an overall information security program that includes policy procedures, incident response, and disaster recovery.

## Software Development Lifecycle

1. Plan
2. Develop
3. Tests
4. Deploy
5. Maintain

Common software development methodologies:

Waterfall
: Top-down approach is a simple and easy to follow, but not very flexible and design flaws can be costly if discovered after the application is deployed.

Agile and Scrum
: Consists of short bursts of analysis, design, coding, and testing. Allows team to be responsive and motivates the team to be productive.

- However, due to cycle deadlines, it is easy to forget about application security testing.

Spiral
: Focuses on minimizing risk, which makes it possible to evaluate security at the end of each cycle. However, not as quick as Agile, and may increase the cost of the software development.

Iterative
: Breaks up development into smaller prototypes through repeated cycles, which allows lessons to be learned from earlier iterations.

### White Box Testing

Provides the attackers with detailed information about the system to target.

- Bypasses many reconnaissance steps normally precedes attacks, shortening the time of the attack, and increasing the likelihood that it will find security flaws.
- Process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. Will be testing internal components of the applications of the application or piece of software, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable time.
- Tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and its expected behavior and more time consuming than black-box testing.

### Black Box Testing

Does not provide attackers with any information prior to the attack.

- Simulates an external attacker trying to gain access to information about the business and technical environment before engaging in an attack.
- The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software.
- Significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.

### Gray Box Testing

Known as partial knowledge tests, are sometimes chosen to balance the advantages and disadvantages of white and black box penetration tests.

- The most popular testing process for things such as penetration testing.
- A combination of both black-box and white-box testing.
- The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software.
- Limited knowledge saves times, and is often chosen for extremely-well-hardened attack surfaces.

### Source Code Analysis Tools

Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
: Analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities prior to the launch of an application and is used to strengthen code.

- Produces fewer false positives, but more implementations require access to the application source code and requires expert configurations and lots of processing power.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
: Find visible vulnerabilities by feeding the URL into an automated scanner. This method is highly scalable, easily integrated, and quick.

- Requires expert configuration.
- High possibility of false positives and negatives.


Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
: A solution that assesses applications from within using software instrumentation. This technique allows us to combine the strengths of both SAST and DAST methods as well as providing access to code, HTTP traffic, library information, back-end connections, and configuration information.

## Application Security Threats and Attacks

Before an organization selects any third-part software, an application security professional should assess the risk and ask questions about the security standards used to develop the software.

### Third Party Software and Supplier Risk Assessment

Third party software standards, patching, and testing.

- Identify how any risks would impact your organizations business.
  - Financial
  - Operational
  - Strategic
- Next step would be to determine the likelihood the risk would interrupt the business.
- Finally, there is a need to identify how the risk would impact the business.

#### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A web application firewall filters, monitors, and blacks HTTP traffic to and and from a web application.

- WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewall serve as a safety gate between servers.
- By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attack stemming from web application security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, viral inclusion, and security misconfigurations.

### Input Validation

- Buffer overflow
- Cross-site scripting
- SQL injection
- Canonicalization - The process of converting data that involves more than one representation into a standard approved format.

### Authentication

- Network eavesdropping
- Brute force attack
- Dictionary attacks
- Cookie replay
- Credential theft

### Authorization

- Elevation of privilege
- Disclosure of confidential data
- Data tampering
- Luring attacks

### Configuration Management

- Unauthorized access to administration interfaces
- Unauthorized access to configuration stores
- Retrieval of clear text configuration data
- Lack of individual accountability; over-privileged process and service accounts.


### Exception Management

- Information disclosure
- Denial of service


### Auditing and Logging

- User denies performing an operation
- Attacker exploits an application without trace
- Attacker covers his or her tracks

### OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks

Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It Represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risk to web applications.

1. **Injection** - When untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query to trick interpreter into executing unintended commands.
2. **Broken Authentication** - Application related to authentication and session management issues allowing the attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens to exploit other users identities temporarily or permanently.
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Attackers may steal or modify protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - Poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents.
5. **Broken Access Control** - Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to are often not properly enforced.
6. **Security Misconfigurations** - Most common seen issue result of insecure default configurations, incomplete, or Ad-hoc configurations.
7. **Cross-site Scripting XSS** - Occurs whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new webpage without proper validation or updates an existing webpage with users data using a browser API that can create HTML or Javascript.
   - Allows hackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser to hijack sessions, deface websites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
8. **Insecure De-serialization** - Leads to remote code execution. Can be used to perform attacks including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.
9. **Using components with known vulnerabilities** - A vulnerable component can be exploited for serious data loss or server takeover.
10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring** - Missing or ineffective integration with incident response allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, extract or destroy data.
    - Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rater than internal processes or monitoring.

## Application Security Standards and Regulations

### Threat Modeling

Threat Modeling
: A process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified, enumerated, and mitigation can be prioritized.

- The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker.

The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:

- Preparation
- Identification
- Mitigation
- Review

However, a complex process needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:

- Threat intelligence
- Asset identification
- Mitigation capabilities
- Risk assessment

To help with this, there are frameworks:

- **STRIDE(Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privileges) methodology** - Introduced in 1999 at Microsoft for developers to find threats in products.
  - _Spoofing_: Requires to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another.
    - Access keys (such as API keys) or signatures via encryption helps remediate this threat.
  - _Tampering_: Help provide integrity to the data. Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate.
  - _Repudiation_: Dictates the use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.
  - _Information Disclosure:_ Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner is shown.
  - **Denial of Service**: Applications and services use up system resources, and measures in place so that the abuse of application/service won't result in down time.
  - **Elevation of Privileges**: The worst-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user who was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level of an administrator. This often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure.
- **P.A.S.T.A** - Stands for process for attack simulation and threat analysis, which is a 7-step methodology.
- **TRIKE** - Using threat models as a risk management tool to satisfy the security auditing process, threat models are based on requirements model.
  - Establish the stakeholder defined acceptable level of risk assigned to each asset class.
  - Analysis of the requirements model yields a threat model for which threats are enumerated and assigned risk values.
- **VAST** - Visual agile and simple threat modeling and necessity of scaling the threat modeling process across the infrastructure and entire SDLC into Agile software development.
