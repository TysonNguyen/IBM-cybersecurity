<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hackers (Pay or not)</strong> = They can be attacks that are paid by private or public organizations. Or simply someone with enough knowledge and time to bother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Users</strong> = They are still the most likely to cause security problems, whether intentional or not. Loss and sale of information is the most normal, along with the installation of malware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Hacktivisim"</strong> = Similar to governments but usually do not have much financial power. Normally they reveal sensitive or confidential information to the public and carry out DDoS campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Governments</strong> = They have enough power to cause very large financial and operational losses, it is normal to attack infrastructure, spy and monitor important politicians and are the most used APT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="motivation-factors"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#motivation-factors"></a>Motivation Factors</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Just Play</strong>: Demonstrate the capabilities of the group or the individual, on the hackers community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gain money</strong>: In conjunction with governments or criminal organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Political action and movements</strong>: Make an statement or fight for a specific reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hire Me!</strong>: Demonstrate what can I do for somebody to hire me or use my services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hacking-organizations"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#hacking-organizations"></a>Hacking organizations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fancy Bear</strong> organization collated with 2016 U.S election hack.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous</strong></li>
<li><strong>Syrian Electronic Army</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guardians of the Peace</strong> caused leaks on Sony and film regarding North Korea dictator to prevent the release of the movie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Government actors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tailor Access Operation</strong> for the United States</li>
<li><strong>National Security Agency, NSA</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unit 61398</strong> from Israel</li>
<li><strong>Unit 8200</strong> from China</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the espionage from countries from different actors will increase with advanced malware and a lot of them.</p>
<p>There will be new technologies and human knowledge gap about cybersecurity and protecting their information.</p>
