<h2 id="characteristics"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#characteristics"></a>Characteristics</h2>
<p>The foundation of robust security is a clearly communicated with a systematic analysis of the threats and controls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build with a clearly communicated structure.</li>
<li>As IT systems increase in complexity, they require a standard set of techniques, tools and communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architectural thinking is about creating and communicating good structure and behavior with the intent of avoiding chaos. Architecture needs to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Described before it can be created.</li>
<li>With different levels of elaboration for communication.</li>
<li>Include a solution for implementation and operations.</li>
<li>That is affordable.</li>
<li>And secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architecture
: A system describes its overall <em>static structure</em> and <em>dynamic behavior</em>. It models the system's elements (which for IT systems are software, hardware and its human users), the externally manifested properties of those elements, and the static and dynamic relationships among them.</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO/IEC 42010: 20071 defines architecture as the "fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution".</li>
