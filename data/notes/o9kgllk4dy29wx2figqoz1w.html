<p>SIEM (System Information Event Management)
: A data aggregator, search, and reporting system. SIEM gathers immense amounts of data from entire networked environment, consolidates and makes that data human accessible. With the data categorized and laid out, you can research data security breaches with as much detail as needed.</p>
<p>Key Terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log Collection</li>
<li>Normalization</li>
<li>Correlation</li>
<li>Aggregation</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A SIEM system collects logs and other security-related documentation for analysis.</li>
<li>The core function is to manage network security by monitoring flows and events.</li>
<li>It consolidates log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout a network. It then uses an advanced Sense Analytics engine to normalize and correlate this data and identifies security offenses requiring investigation.</li>
<li>A SIEM system cane be ruled-based or employ a statistical correlation engine to establish relationships between event log entries.</li>
<li>Capture log event and network flow data in near real time and apply advanced analytics to reveal security offenses.</li>
<li>It can be available on premises and in a cloud environment.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="events--flows"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#events--flows"></a>Events &#x26; Flows</h3>
<p>Event
: Typically a log of a specific action such as a user login, or a FW permit, occurs at a specific time and the event is logged at that time.</p>
<p>Flows
: A record of network activity between two hosts that can last for seconds to days depending on the activity within the session.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a web request might download multiple files such as images, ads, video, and last for 5 to 10 seconds, or a user who watches a Netflix movie might be in a network session that last up to a few hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-collection"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#data-collection"></a>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Data Collection
: The process of collecting flows and logs from different sources into a common repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be performed by sending data directly into the SIEM or an external device can collect log data from the source and move it into the SIEM system on demand or scheduled.</li>
<li>Consider CPU, memory, storage capacity, license, and number of sources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="normalization"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#normalization"></a>Normalization</h3>
<p>Normalization
: Process involves turning raw data into a format that has fields such as IP address that the SIEM can use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normalization involves parsing raw event data and preparing the data to display readable information.</li>
<li>Normalization allows for predictable and consistent storage for all records, and indexes those records for fast searching and sorting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="license-throttling"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#license-throttling"></a>License Throttling</h3>
<p>License Throttling
: Monitors the number of incoming events to the system to mange input queues and EPS licensing.</p>
<h3 id="coalescing"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#coalescing"></a>Coalescing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Events are parsed and then coalesced based on common attributes across events.
<ul>
<li>QRadar: Event coalescing starts after three events have been found with matching properties within a 10 second period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Event data received by QRader is processed in to normalized fields, along with the original payload. Five properties are evaluated:
<ul>
<li>QID</li>
<li>Source IP</li>
<li>Destination IP</li>
<li>Destination port</li>
<li>Username</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="events"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#events"></a>Events</h3>
<p>Event Collector
: Collects event from local and remote log sources, and normalizes raw log source events to format for use by QRadar. The Event Collector bundles or coalesces identical events to conserve system usage and sends the data to the Event Processor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can use bandwidth limiters and schedules to send events to the Event Processor to overcome WAN limitations such as intermittent connectivity.</li>
<li>Bundles or coalesces identical events to conserve system usage and sends the data to the Event Processor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Event Processor
: Processes events that are collected from one or more Event Collector components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Processes event by using the Custom Rules Engine (CRE).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flows"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#flows"></a>Flows</h3>
<p>Flow Collector
: Generates flow data from raw packets that are collected from monitor ports such as SPANs, TAPs and monitor sessions, or from external flow sources such as netflow, sflow, jflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is then converted to QRadar flow format and sent down the pipeline for processing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="flow-processor"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#flow-processor"></a>Flow Processor</h4>
<p>Flow De-duplication
: A process that removes duplicate flows when multiple Flow Collectors provide data to Flow Processors appliances.</p>
<p>Asymmetric Recombination
: Responsible for combining two sides of each flow when data is provided asymmetrically. This process can recognize flows from each side and combine them in to one record. However, sometimes only one side of the flow exists.</p>
<p>License Throttling
: Monitors the number of incoming flows to the system to manage input queues and licensing.</p>
<p>Forwarding
: Applies routing rules for the system, such as sending flow data to offsite targets, external Syslog systems, JSON systems, and other SIEMs.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-add-event-or-flow-collectors-to-all-in-one-deployment"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#reasons-to-add-event-or-flow-collectors-to-all-in-one-deployment"></a>Reasons to Add Event or Flow Collectors to All-in-One Deployment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data collection requirements exceed the collection capability of processor.</li>
<li>Must collect events and flows at a different location than processor is installed.</li>
<li>Monitoring packet-based flow sources.</li>
<li>As deployment grows, the workload exceeds the processing capacity of the All-in-One appliance.</li>
<li>Security operations center employs more analysts who do more concurrent searches.</li>
<li>The types of monitored data, and the retention period for that data increases, which increases processing and storage requirements.</li>
<li>As security analyst team grows, requires better search performance.</li>
