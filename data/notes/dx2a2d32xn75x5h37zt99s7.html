<p>Auditors are looking for:</p>
<p>Accuracy
: Controls results being assessed for pass/fail.</p>
<p>Completeness
: Do controls implementation cover the entire offering; e.g. no gaps in inventory, personnel, etc.</p>
<p>Timeliness
: Controls are performed on time (or early) with no gaps in coverage.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a control cannot be performed on time, are there appropriate assessment (risk) approvals <strong>BEFORE</strong> the control is considered 'late'.</li>
</ul>
<p>with Resilience notice
: Checks/Balances in place such that if a control does fail.</p>
<p>Consistency
: Shifting control implementation raises concerns about above, plus increase testing.</p>
