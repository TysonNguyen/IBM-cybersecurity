<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>
: Synonymous with privacy. Confidentiality measures prevent data from falling into the hands of people who not have authorization to access said information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong>
: In the Information Technology world, integrity is all about making sure information is accurate and always stays that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>
: Ensuring availability requires routine maintenance and upgrading of hardware, software and operating system environments.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability-assessments"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vulnerability-assessments"></a>Vulnerability Assessments</h2>
<p><strong>The process to search for weaknesses/exposures in order to apply a patch or fix to prevent a compromise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider that many systems are shipping with: known and unknown security holes and bugs, and insecure default settings (passwords, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many vulnerabilities occur as a result of misconfigurations by system administrators.</p>
