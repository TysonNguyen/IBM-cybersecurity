## Information Security

According to the National Institute of Standards' (NIST) - *"The protection of information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability."*

## The CIA Triad

1. **Confidentiality**
: Synonymous with privacy. Confidentiality measures prevent data from falling into the hands of people who not have authorization to access said information.

2. **Integrity**
: In the Information Technology world, integrity is all about making sure information is accurate and always stays that way.

3. **Availability**
: Ensuring availability requires routine maintenance and upgrading of hardware, software and operating system environments.

## Key Terms

**Vulnerability**
: A flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate system security policy.

**Threat**
: An event, natural, or man-made, able to cause negative impact to an organization.

**Exploit**
: A defined way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability.

**Risk**
: A situation involving exposure to danger.

## Vulnerability Assessments

**The process to search for weaknesses/exposures in order to apply a patch or fix to prevent a compromise.**

- Consider that many systems are shipping with: known and unknown security holes and bugs, and insecure default settings (passwords, etc.).

- Many vulnerabilities occur as a result of misconfigurations by system administrators.

## Roles in Security

**CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)**
: High-level management position responsible for the entire computer security department and staff.
  
**Information Security Architect**
: Designs a security system or major components of a security system, and may head a security design team building a new security system.

**Information Security Consultant/Specialist**
: Broad titles that encompass any one or all other roles by protecting computers, networks, software, data, and/or information systems against viruses, worms, spyware, malware, intrusion detection, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and increasing list of attacks.

**Information Security Analyst**
: Conducts information security assessments for organizations and analyzes the events, alerts, alarms and any information that could be useful to identify any threats that could compromise the organization.

**Information Security Auditor**
: In charge of testing the effectiveness of computer information systems, including the security of the systems and reports their findings.

**Security Software Developer**
: Develops security software, including tools for monitoring, traffic analysis, intrusion detection, virus/spyware/malware detection, anti-virus software, and so on. Also integrates/implements security into applications software.

**Penetration Tester / Ethical Hacker**
: Not only scans for and identifies vulnerabilities, but exploits them to provide hard evidence that they are vulnerabilities. When penetration-testing, large infrastructures such as power grids, utility systems, and nuclear facilities, large teams of penetration testers, called Red Teams, are employed.

**Vulnerability Assessor**
: Scans for, identifies and assesses vulnerabilities in IT systems including computers, networks, software systems, information systems, and applications software.
