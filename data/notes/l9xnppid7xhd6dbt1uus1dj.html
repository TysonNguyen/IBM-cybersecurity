<h1 id="security-operations-center-soc"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#security-operations-center-soc"></a>Security Operations Center (SOC)</h1>
<p>A security operation center is a team of IT security professionals monitoring a company's network and systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find vulnerabilities on the network</strong>: A vulnerability is a weakness that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level. 
<ul>
<li>The SOC might discover a set of MS Windows computers that must be patched against a specific published vulnerability.</li>
<li>Vulnerabilities are not necessarily the SOCâ€™s responsibility; however, unfixed vulnerabilities affect the security level of the entire company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Detect unauthorized activity</strong>: It is crucial to detect any unauthorized activity quickly before it causes any damage.</li>
<li><strong>Discover policy violations</strong>: A security policy is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threats and ensure compliance.
<ul>
<li>What is considered a violation would vary from one company to another; example include downloading pirated media files and sending confidential company files insecurely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Detect intrusions: Intrusions refer to system and network intrusions.</li>
<li><strong>Support with the incident response</strong>: An incident can be an observation, a policy violation, an intrusion attempt, or something more damaging such as a major breach.
<ul>
<li>Responding correctly to a severe incident is not an easy task. The SOC can support the incident response team handle the situation.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="data-sources"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#data-sources"></a>Data Sources</h3>
<p>The SOC uses many data sources to monitor the network for signs of intrusions and to detect any malicious behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server logs</strong>: There are many types of servers on a network, such as a mail server, web server, and domain controller on MS Windows networks.
<ul>
<li>Logs can contain information about various activities such as successful and failed login attempts, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DNS activity</strong>: DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is the protocol responsible for converting a domain name to an IP address.
<ul>
<li>The SOC can gather information about domain names that internal systems are trying to communicate with by inspecting DNS queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Firewall logs</strong>: A firewall is a device that controls network packets entering and leaving the network by letting them through or blocking them.</li>
<li><strong>DHCP logs</strong>: DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and it is responsible for assigning an IP address to the systems that try to connect to a network.
<ul>
<li>Inspecting DHCP transactions can learn about the devices that joined the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="soc-services"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#soc-services"></a>SOC Services</h3>
<p>Services include reactive and proactive services in addition to other services.</p>
<p>Reactive services refer to tasks initiated after detecting an intrusion or a malicious event.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor security posture</strong>: The primary role of the SOC, and it includes monitoring the network and computers for security alerts and notifications and responding to them.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability management</strong>: Refers to finding vulnerabilities in the company systems and patching (fixing) them. The SOC can assist but not necessarily execute them.</li>
<li><strong>Malware analysis</strong>: The SOC might recover malicious programs that reached the network.
<ul>
<li>Can do basic analysis by executing it in a controlled environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intrusion detection</strong>: An IDS is used to detect and log intrusions and suspicious packets. The SOC's job is to main such a system, monitor its alerts, and go through its logs as the need dictates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proactive services refer to tasks handled by the SOC without any indicator of an intrusion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network security monitoring (NSM):</strong> Focuses on monitoring the network data and analyzing the traffic to detect signs of intrusions.</li>
<li><strong>Threat hunting</strong>: The SOC assumes an intrusions has already taken place and begins its hunt to see if they can confirm this assumption.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Intelligence</strong>: Focuses on learning about potential adversaries and their tactics and techniques to improve the company's defenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other services include cyber security training. Many data breaches and intrusions can be avoided by raising users' security awareness.</p>
<h3 id="example-scenario"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#example-scenario"></a>Example Scenario</h3>
<p>One role in a SOC is the SOC analyst. A SOC analyst is responsible for network security monitoring and log management.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notices a particular DNS query repeating every minute - a behavior unusual for normal user browsing the internet.
<ul>
<li>Discover a process (program) using DNS to communicate with a malicious server.</li>
<li>Found out the computer was infected after visiting a malicious website by reviewing the computer logs.</li>
<li>The laptop is cleaned, and threat hunting starts to ensure that no other computers are infected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
