<p>We engage, or are involved in processes all the time; in both our personal and professional lives.</p>
<h3 id="processes-and-it-security"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#processes-and-it-security"></a>Processes and IT Security</h3>
<p>Cyberattacks and Alerts are increasing and growing exponentially complex and targeted.</p>
<p>This requires more time and attention from Security Analysts. IT Security teams are increasingly needing to take charge of their threat management operations with a proactive approach.</p>
<h3 id="enabling-success"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#enabling-success"></a>Enabling Success</h3>
<p>Security Operations Centers (SOC) need to have the current key skills, tools, and processes to be able to detect, investigate and stop threats before they become costly data breaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>As volumes of security alerts and false positives grow, more burden is placed upon Security Analyst &#x26; Incident Response Teams.</li>

<p>Process
: A set of defined, repeatable steps that take inputs, add value, and produce outputs that satisfy a customer's requirements.</p>
<p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3c1915d227e89fd8c51f76b03e35f615?rik=VFqSeT1R7agvsg&#x26;riu=http%3a%2f%2f1.bp.blogspot.com%2f-oCGLWHjH4e0%2fThHUctRzMjI%2fAAAAAAAAAvk%2f4U_XNzE3f74%2fs1600%2f5.bmp&#x26;ehk=m0D00RFj4drgR1hxyrkCx%2f2Veh7Zr79IGZaEJvzDzxY%3d&#x26;risl=&#x26;pid=ImgRaw&#x26;r=0" alt="Business Process"></p>
<p>Inputs
: Information or materials that are required by the process to get started.</p>
<p>Outputs
: Services, or products that satisfy customer requirements.</p>
<p>Bounds/Scope
: The process starts when...and ends when...</p>
<p>Tasks/Steps
: Actions that are repeatable.</p>

<p><em>What makes a process successful?</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Charter</li>
<li>Clear Objectives</li>

<p>Regular review of:</p>
<p>Process Metrics → Customer Feedback → Maturity Assessments → Financial Performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Continual and process improvement refer to as CPI. It is the ongoing cycle of always reviewing process performance metrics and customer feedback.</li>
<li>Small improvement teams are critical because key individuals and SMEs get together from a department with the process owner.</li>
