<p>Supply-chain attacks (aka value-chain attacks or third-party attacks) are attacks when someone infiltrates your system through an outside partner or provider with access to your systems and data. This includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Data management companies</li>
<li>Law firms</li>
<li>Email providers</li>

<ul>
<li>$2.1 million is the average annual spend on vetting third parties → 64% say the processes used are only somewhat or not effective.</li>
<li>40% of organizations use manual procedures, like spreadsheets and 51% employ risk scanning tools, to vet their third parties → 34% said results of these tools are only somewhat valuable while 20% said results don't provide any insights.</li>
<li>Third parties are spending 15,000 hours a year on completing assessments, at ana average cost of $1.9 million annually → Over 55% said these assessments only somewhat or not accurately reflect their security posture.</li>
<li>Only 8% of assessments result in action (eg. disqualification of a vendor or a requirement to remediate gaps) → If assessments revealed gaps, only 26% of respondents say their organizations terminated the relationship.</li>

<p>When companies began extensively outsourcing and globalizing the supply chain in the 1980's and 1990's, they did so without understanding the risks suppliers posed...Lack of physical or cybersecurity at supplier sites could result in a breach of corporate data systems or product corruption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personnel in supplier companies that have access to the data, systems or facilities of their customers.</li>
<li>Any service provider-from janitorial services to system maintenance- or any provider with access to company information poses a potential cyber risk.</li>
<li>Products with embedded IT that will be integrated into their customer's systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nist-supply-chain-risk-management-scrm-guidance"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#nist-supply-chain-risk-management-scrm-guidance"></a>NIST Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Guidance</h2>
<p>A primary objective of cyber SCRM is to identify, assess, and mitigate products and services that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing and development practices within the cyber supply chain. Cyber SCRM activities may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining cybersecurity requirements for suppliers.</li>
<li>Enacting cybersecurity requirements through formal agreement.</li>
<li>Communicating to suppliers how those cybersecurity requirements will be verified and validated.</li>
<li>Verifying that cybersecurity requirements are met through a variety of assessment methodologies.  </li>
<li>Governing and managing all the above.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-practices"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#best-practices"></a>Best Practices</h2>
<p>Evaluation
: of the security and privacy practices of all third parties - Conduct regular audit and assessments to evaluate security and privacy practices of third parties.</p>
<p>Inventory
: All third parties that have shared information - Track all third parties that have access to sensitive data and how many of these parties are sharing this data with others.</p>
<p>Frequent
: Review third-party management policies and programs - Implement formal processes to regularly evaluate security and privacy practices of third and nth parties to address new technologies and innovations.</p>
<p>3rd Party Notification
: Mandate that third parties provide information and transparency into their party relationships prior to sharing sensitive data.</p>
<p>Oversight
: Involve senior leadership and boards of directors in third-party risk management programs. High-level attention to third-party risk may increase the budget available to address these threats.</p>

<p><a href="https://info.cybergrx.com/hubfs/Content-Assets/CyberGRX%20Ponemon%20Report.pdf">Third-party breaches remain a dominant security challenge for organizations, with over 63% 1 of breaches linked to a third party. To prevent or mitigate the severity of a third-party data breach or cyber exploit, organizations can implement a variety of cybersecurity risk management controls such as assessing compliance with regulations, vetting third-party security practices and establishing data breach and cyber exploit incident response procedures.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Third party breaches remain an expensive problem.</li>
<li>IT security professionals still believe their TPCRM programs are immature.</li>
<li>Using a combination of automated tools provides better results.</li>
