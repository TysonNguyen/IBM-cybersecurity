## Why Patching?

- All operating systems (OS) require some type of patching.
- **Patching is the fundamental and most important thing an organization can do to prevent malicious attacks.**

Patch
: A set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called *bugfixes* or *bug fixes*, and improving the functionality, usability or performance.

## Windows Patching

- Windows Updates allow for fixes to known flaws in Microsoft products and operating systems. The fixes, known as patches, are modifications to software and hardware to help improve performance, reliability, and security.
- Microsoft releases patches in a monthly cycle, commonly referred to as "Patch Tuesday," the second Tuesday of every month.

### Types of Updates for Windows

Security Updates
: Security updates for Windows work to protect against new and ongoing threats. They are classified as Critical, Important, Moderate, Low, or non-rated.

Critical Updates
: These are high priority updates. When these are released, they need to be updated as soon as possible. It is recommended to have these set as automatic.

Software Updates
: Software updates are not critical. They often expand features and improve the reliability of the software.

Service Packs
: These are roll-ups, or a compilation, of all previous updates to ensure that you are up to date on all of the patches since the release of the product up to a particular date. If your system is behind on updates, then service packs bring your system up to date.

### Windows Application Patching

- Un-patched software, especially if a widely used app like Adobe Flash or Internet Explorer, can be a magnet for malware and viruses.
- 87% of the vulnerabilities found in the top 50 programs affected third-party programs such as Adobe Flash Player and Reader, Java, Skype, various media players and others outside the Microsoft ecosystem. The remaining 13% "stem from operating systems and Microsoft programs," according to Secunia's Vulnerability Review report.
